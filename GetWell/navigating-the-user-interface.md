# Navigating the Skillable Lab Client User Interface

This guide will help learners with navigating and getting acquainted with the Lab user interface of the Skillable lab client. 

In general, when a learner launches a lab, the lab interface is displayed in two different configurations, depending on the lab components used when the lab was built:

- Virtualization based labs are displayed in a single browser window.
- Cloud based labs are displayed in two browser windows.

>[!alert] Some buttons or menus may not be available to you, depending on your account configuration.
