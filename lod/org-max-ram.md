## Max RAM Per Lab Profile

- These settings limit the maximum amount of RAM that a lab belonging to this organization can have. This is enforced when editing lab and virtual machine profiles. If a change would cause a lab to exceed this limit, the operation will be blocked. Changes that do not increase the amount of RAM, LOD will allow the update. Disabled lab profiles are not validated for max RAM. Re-enabling a lab will cause validation to occur and if the lab profile causes the RAM limit to be exceeded, LOD will not allow the lab profile to be re-enabled.

- Max RAM limit is set to 50GB by default.
