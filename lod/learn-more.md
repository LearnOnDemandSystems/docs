- [Replacement Tokens](feature-focus/cloud-resource-templates/replacement-tokens.md)

    - Replacement tokens use the syntax &commat;lab.replacementTokenName. You can see the list of all &commat;lab replacement tokens available to your lab by simply editing the instructions, and clicking on the &commat;lab button.
