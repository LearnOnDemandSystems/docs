# How Do I Extend The Amount Of Time On The Lab Timer?

Each running lab will have a timer in the upper right corner that shows you the amount of time left before the lab will be cancelled (if no activity performed in lab) or be saved and closed automatically (if saving is allowed for the lab). Most but not all labs can have their times extended. 

To extend the time you have two options; 

1. Wait until a pop-up window appears when there is less than 10 minutes remaining and then click **Yes** to extend the lab by 15 minutes. 

1. The second option provides more time:

    1. [] Click Exit in the top right corner of the lab
    
    1. Click **Save and Close Lab**. 
    
    1. In the **Confirm Save** window, click **OK** and close the window. 

> [!KNOWLEDGE] Remember, not all labs can be extended or saved.
