# Is There A Quick Way To Switch Virtual Machines?

There are two options to switch Virtual Machines. Depending on the lab, the quickest way is to use the **Machines** or **Resources** menu. At the top of the lab interface, click the name of the machine you are currently viewing. On the Machines and Resources menu, all virtual machines in the lab are listed. Select the one you want to switch to. Alternately, in IDL (legacy) labs,  you can use the **Machines** tab on the Navigation pane to switch to a different machine by clicking on it.
