## How do I capture a screenshot to send to the Help Desk team?

When contacting the Learn on Demand Systems Help Desk Team, it is often helpful, and in some cases required, for you to send us a screenshot to show what kind of difficulty you are having. Capturing the right information can help us help you more effectively. Use the following information and screenshot examples as a guide for capturing and submitting your error messages or other issues that you might be having.

First, use the Windows-based screenshot tools to capture what you need. On some Windows editions (Vista and newer) you can use a tool called the **Snipping Tool**.

To open the Snipping Tool:

1. Click the **Start** button, and under **All Programs (or Apps) > Accessories**, click **Snipping Tool**. 

1. Once the snipping tool is open, select **New**, which will turn your whole display (or multiple displays if you have them) a shaded grey-white color. 
     1. To manually select how much of your screen you want to capture, click and drag.  
     1. Alternatively, you can click on the drop-down menu next to **New** button and select **Window Snip**, and then specify which window you want to capture. 
1. Once you have captured the snip, make sure to save it so that you can send it to the Help Desk.

If you use the **Print Screen (PrtScn)** button on your keyboard, it will capture a full screen image of whatever monitor you are currently on. This key is near the upper-right corner of your keyboard. (Depending on the type of keyboard you have, the exact key names on your keyboard may vary slightly.) Follow these instructions to immediately create a file from the capture to send to the Help Desk:

1. Click **Start**, click **Accessories**, and then click **Paint**. (or WordPad, etc.)

1. In the application window (Paint or WordPad), click **Edit**, and then click **Paste**.

1. When the image appears in the application window, click **File**, and then click **Save As**.

1. In the **Save As** dialog box, in the **File name** box, type a name for the screen shot, and then click **Save**.

If you aren’t using a Microsoft Windows operating system, please refer to your system’s documentation on the best tools to capture a screenshot.

Once you have the correct screenshot(s), you need to submit them to our Help Desk at https://lod.one/help. When submitting a ticket, at the bottom of the form, there is a place to include any screenshot(s) that you have taken as attachments.
