# Activities

 Activities are configured in the lab instructions, using the lab instruction editor. Activities can be modified at anytime, by anyone that has access to edit the lab instructions. When an Activity is created, it is represented in the lab instructions by a Replacement Token. 

Activities fall into two broad categories: Questions and Automated. 
- Questions are simply multiple choice or short answer questions. 
- Automated Activities have a script configured to run against a cloud subscription or virtual machines running on Hyper-V or VMware in the lab.  

> [!KNOWLEDGE] If your lab profile does not use a Cloud Subscription, or if it does not have virtual machines configured, Automated Activities are not available in the Activities menu. 

To get started with Activities:

1. Navigate to your **lab profile**.

1. Click **Edit Instructions**.

1. Click the **Activities icon** to enter the settings Activities menu in your lab instructions.

## Automated Activity

Automated Activities are PowerShell Windows command Shell Shell scripts that target a Cloud Subscription, or virtual machine running on Hyper-V or VMware in the lab. Cloud Subscriptions are targeted by a PowerShell script, and Windows-based virtual machines can be targeted by both PowerShell and Shell. Automated Activities support using @lab replacement tokens in scripts as well. Automated Activities can be used to help make sure the student has configured their lab environment correctly, help the student understand mistakes that are made in their lab, as well as give the student confirmation that they are completing the lab instructions correctly. Automated Activities can also be used to automate any configuration or lab steps that you wish to automate. 

### Automated Activity Syntax

Along with traditional PowerShell, Windows Command Shell, and Bash syntax, there is additional syntax that can be used. 

- Setting Lab Variables: sets a variable that can be recalled in subsequent lab instructions using @lab replacement tokens, as many times as neccessary. 

- Sending Lab Notifications: Sends a a popup notification to the lab, using the text specified in the syntax.

- Scoring: used to determine how much of the score value the lab user will receive for the activity. This can be used to award partial score values for the automated activity. The partial score is dictated by a numerical value in the syntax, that represents the percentage of the score value that will be awarded. For Windows Command Shell and Bash, you can also display a message in the lab instructions with text specified scoring syntax.

#### **PowerShell** 

- **Setting Variables**
    
    `Set-LabVariable -Name firstName -Value John`

    `Set-LabVariable -Name lastName -Value Smith`

- **Sending Lab Notifications**

    `Send-LabNotification -Message "Hello from a script"`

- **Scoring**

    `Set-ActivityResult .5 -Correct`

#### **Windows Command Shell and Bash**

- **Setting Variables**
    
    `set_lab_variable "firstname" "John"`

    `set_lab_variable "lastname" "Smith"`

- **Sending Lab Notifications**

    `send_lab_notification "Hello from a script"`

    `send_lab_notification "I hope you're doing well"`

- **Scoring**

    `set_activity_result .5 "good job!"`

### Automated Activity Creation

1. If you would like the lab to be scored, Click the **switch** next to _Enable Scoring_. If you would not like the lab to be scored, simply leave the **Switch** turned off. 

1. Click **New Automated Activity**.

![](../lod/images/new-automated-activity.png)

- **Name**: this will be the title of the automated Activity, and will be displayed in the lab instruction editor, in the activities menu.

- **Instructions**: this is where instructions for the Activity are entered, and will be displayed to students, in the lab instructions. 

- **Scored**: enables the question to be scored. Scoring must be enabled in your lab. [Scoring is covered below in this document](#scoring).

- **Display Scripts as Task List**: enables the script to be displayed as a Task List. This is useful when there is more than one script configured on an Activity. *Display Scripts as Task List* will take the **Text** field from each *Script* created within the activity and insert it in to the Instructions page with a box next to it that has a question mark. This is where users are able to manually run a check against those scripts to see if they are correct or not.  The boxes will then change to Green with a check for correct or Red with an X for incorrect and report any script output associated with them.

    > [!KNOWLEDGE] If **Display Scripts as Task List** is checked, On-Demand Evaluation will no longer be available for this Activity. 

- **On-Demand Evaluation**: enables a button that the user can click to check their answer to a question, or to score their answer if Activities are set to be scored.
 
- **Allow retries**: allows the user to retry a question if they enter or select an incorrect answer. This option is not available when On-Demand Evaluation is disabled. 

- **Required for submission**: requires the student to perform the Activity, to submit their lab for grading.

- **Blocks page navigation**: checking this box prevents the student from navigating to the next page in the lab instructions, unless they have entered or selected an answer to this question. 

- **Correct answer feedback**: this will be displayed to the user upon entering or selecting a correct answer to a question. 

- **Incorrect answer feedback**: this will be displayed to the user upon entering or selecting a incorrect answer to a question. 

- **Script 1**:
    - **Score Value**: the score value the student will recieve for completing the Activity correctly. This score contributes to their overall score in the lab.
    - **Target**: the virtual machine or cloud subscription that the script will target. Cloud subscriptions must be targeted by PowerShell, and virtual machines running on Hyper-V or VMware can be targeted by PowerShell or Windows Command Shell. Linux-based VMs running Hyper-V or VMware can be targeted by Bash.
    - **Language**: the scripting language that will be used. PowerShell, Windows Command Shell, and Bash are supported. Enabling Bash scripting or terminal connections will not take effect on running lab instances, users will have to relaunch their lab.
    - **Script**: enter the script that will be executed. @lab replacement tokens that are used in scripts will be replaced in the lab instructions when the lab is launched.

    - **New Script**: click to add an additional script to this Activity. The new script will be represented by a button, in a Task List. 

    >[!knowledge] @lab Replacement Tokens can be used in Activity scripts, to replace data in the lab instructions that is not known at the time of authoring the lab instructions, by inserting a Replacement Token in the lab instructions where you want data to be replaced in the lab.

    The following two options are **only available if Display Scripts as Task list is checked**, and are located in the section for the script they belong to. This allows you to provide custom feedback on each Automated Activity. 

    - **Correct answer feedback**: you can enter text here, or you can use scripts to generate a response to the student.  

    - **Incorrect answer feedback**: you can enter text here, or you can use scripts to generate a response to the student.  

### Automated Activity Output

You can optionally store automated activity output separately from a script message that the student receives in the lab when they complete the automated activity. This allows you to display a message to the student in the lab, but leave more detailed evidence for reporting or remediation. 

An example, if you wanted to capture a list of all running services in a virtual machine, at a specific point in the lab. You could create an automated that uses PowerShell to target a Windows virtual machine with the following script:

```
Get-Service | Format-List *
Set-ActivityResult -Correct -Message 'You got it!'
```
When the student clicks the button in the lab to trigger the automated activity, the script will capture a list of running services and store them on the lab instance details page, and will display "You got it!" to the student in the lab. 

### Automated Activity Best Practices and Guidelines

- Use Automated Activities in areas of your lab when students are prone to making mistakes. A PowerShell script, such as the example shown below, helps students to make sure their lab is configured appropriately so that they do not get an error when trying to complete steps later in the lab.  

- Provide the student feedback with your scripts where possible, to help them complete the lab instructions correctly. An if/else statement in your script works very well in this situation, to provide unique feedback depending on if the student gave the correct answer or not. 

- If more than one script is configured on an Activity, the scripts will execute in sequential order. If one of your scripts is relying on another script to be completed, make sure you order the scripts appropriately to prevent your Automated Activity from not working correctly. 

- Automated Activities support PowerShell Windows Command Shell, and Bash. Cloud Subscriptions must be targeted by a PowerShell script, and virtual machines running on Hyper-V or VMware can be targeted by PowerShell or Windows Command  Shell. Linux-based VMs running Hyper-V or VMware can be targeted by Bash.

### Automated Activity Notifications and Variables

Automated activity scripts can set a variable and send notifications to the student, to draw attention to some information or to notify the student of the outcome of the script once it is completed. This allows the student to progress through the lab instructions, without waiting for the result from the script. 

You can also use @lab replacement tokens, to replace information in the notification. This allows the lab author to provide more specific information to the student.  

You can set a variable and send a notification using the the variable in the following example. This example uses 2 PowerShell scripts. 

**Script 1**

```
Set-LabVariable -Name Directory -Value C:/users/student/documents
Set-ActivityResult -Correct
```

**Script 2**

```
Send-LabNotification -Message "Use this directory: @lab.Variable(Directory)!"
Set-ActivityResult -Correct
```

## Questions

Activities in your lab can be configured to use the following types of questions:
- Multiple choice
    - Single answer
    - Multiple answers
- Short answer
    - Exact match
    - Regex match

Optionally, you can enable scoring for Questions in your lab. Once scoring is enabled:

- You will be presented with a text field where you can enter the passing score the student will need to achieve in the lab. 
- You can enable scoring only on the questions you wish to be scored. Questions that are not scored, are considered practice or review and do not contribute to the student's overall score in the lab. 
- Each question that is scored is given a score value, and that value is awarded to the student by selecting the correct answer to the question.   
- If Scoring is not enabled, you do not need to decide which questions will be scored and which will not be scored.

## Scoring

Scoring allows the student to be given a score for each Activity they complete correctly, and those scores contribute to the student's overall score in the lab. As the lab author, you set the passing score for the lab after you enable scoring in the lab. 

> [!KNOWLEDGE] When Scoring is enabled, it is not required to make each question scored. As a lab author, you are free to decide which Activities have a score value associated, and only score the questions that you wish to.

To enable Scoring in your lab:

1. Click the **Activities icon** to enter the settings menu for Activities.

1. Click the **switch** to enable Scoring. 

1. Enter a **passing score** for the lab. You may change this at anytime, as often as you would like. 

    ![](../lod/images/activities-menu-scoring-enabled.png)

1. After Scoring is enabled, you will see the Score checkbox available to select on all Activities you have created, while editing that Activity.

1. Click the checkbox to enable scoring, and enter a score for that Activity. 

    ![](../lod/images/score-scored-checkboxes.png)

1. The student will be given the score value upon completing the Activity correctly. 

### Partial Scoring

Partial scoring allows a student to recieve partial credit for a task in the lab, instead of the score being all or nothing. 

For example, if the lab instructions had a task to create a directory and name it "MyDirectory", and the student created the directory but didn't name it properly -- they could recieve partial credit for creating the directory, even though they didn't name it properly. 

Partial scoring is achieved with automated Activities in IDLx. To configure partial scoring for the example above:

1. Edit the **lab instructions**.
1. **Enable scoring** from the Activities menu.
1. **Add** an automated Activity.
1. In the **Script 1** field, enter a PowerShell script to check for the directory the student created.
1. Assign a score value for script 1. This will be the partial score the student will receive if the directory is created. 
1.  Click _New Script_.
1. In the **Script 2** field, enter a PowerShell script to verify the directory is named properly. 
1. Assign a score value for script 2. This will be the partial score the student will receive if the directory is name properly.

### Performance Based Testing 

Labs can be scored with a performance based testing scenario by leaving the _On-demand_ checbox unchecked, when creating automated activities. When activities are configured this way, they are scored when the lab is completed by the student. The score can be obtained by viewing the lab instance details. 

![](images/display-as-task-list.png)

## Activity Management

After Activities are created, they can be modified at any time, using the Activity editing menu. 

To access this menu, simply click the **Activities Icon**

![](../lod/images/activity-icon.png)

![](../lod/images/activities-edit-menu.png)
