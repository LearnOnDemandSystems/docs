# Custom Access Control Lists

Access control lists (ACLs) are used to control how students use the Web within a virtual machine.

## Creating an Access Control List (ACL)

To create an Access Control List:

ACLs use blacklists and whitelists. Domains added to the blacklist will not be resolvable, and domains added to the whitelist will resolve. You can also allow or deny domains based on  expressions. 

1. From the Admin page in Lab on Demand, click **Access Control Lists** on the Virtual Machines tile.  

1. Click **Create Access Control List**.

    ![](images/create-access-control-list.png)

1. Complete the following fields:

    - **Name**: The display name of the ACL.
    - **Description**: description of the ACL.
    - **Organization**: the organization the ACL will be available to.
    - **Parent (optional)**: Access Control Lists can optionally be set to inherit a parent ACL. Any domains on an ACL that is used as a parent ACL, will be added to the child ACL.  
    - **Enabled**: select to enable this ACL for use. 

1. Under **Blacklist**:
    - In the **Domains** field, enter any domains you want to dissallow access to in the lab, each on a newline.

    - In the **Expressions** field, enter any regular expressions, each on a newline.

1. Under **Whitelist**:
    - In the **Domains** field, enter any domains you want to allow access to in the lab, each on a newline.

    - In the **Expressions** field, enter any regular expressions, each on a newline.

Domains and expressions added to the Blacklist will be superceeded by domains and expressions added to the Whitelist. 

For example, you could:
- Add `.*learnondemandsystems\.com` to the blacklist expressions field
- Add `docs.learnondemandsystems.com` to the whitelist domains field

This configuration would block the VM from accessing learnondemandsystems.com, but would allow access to docs.learnondemandsystems.com

>[!knowledge] Some browswers may handle regex differently and you may need to adjust regex expressions. For example, some browsers may work with an expression like`.*\.learnondemandsystems\.com` and some browsers may work better with an expression like `.*learnondemandsystems\.com`.

## Assigning an Access Control List

Access Control lists are assigned to a lab profile, on the Networks tab. Custom Access Control lists are only available with **Web Access (NAT)** network types.

**Before you assign an access control list, VMs in the lab environment must be configured to pull DNS from the lab gateway, otherwise there may be false positive blocks. If using a DNS server inside the lab, it should have the gateway address assigned as the primary forwarder.**

1. Navigate to the lab profile you wish to configure an ACL on. 

1. Click **Edit** in the upper-right, to edit the lab profile. 

1. Click the **Networks** tab

1. On the Web Access (NAT) network you wish to add the ACL to, click **Choose** to select the ACL that will be applied.

1. Click **Save**. 

## Regex Tips

Some of the most frequently used parts of regex syntax:

|Expression|Description|
|---|---|
|.|Matches any single character (use "\." to match a ".").|
|[abc]|Matches one of the characters ([abc] matches a single "a" or "b" or "c")|
|[c-g]|Matches one of the characters in the range ("[c-g]" matches a single "c" or "d" or "e" or "f" or "g".|
||"[a-z0-9]" matches any single letter or digit.|
||"[-/.:?]" matches any single "-" or "/" or "." or ":" or "?".).|
|?|None or one of the preceding ("words?" will match "word" and "words".|
||"[abc]?" matches a single "a" or "b" or "c" or nothing (i.e. "")).|
|*|None or more of the preceding ("words*" will match "word", "words" and "wordsssssss". ".*" will match anything including nothing).|
|+|One or more of the preceding ("xxx+" will match a sequence of 3 or more "x").|
|(expr1\|expr2)|One of the expressions, which in turn may contain a similar construction ("(foo\|bar)" will match "foo" or "bar". "(foo\|bar)? will match "foo" or "bar" or nothing (i.e. "")).|
|$|The end of the line ("(foo\|bar)$" will match "foo" or "bar"only at the end of a line).|
|\x|Disable the special meaning of x where x is one of the special regex characters ".?*+()^$[]{}\"  ("\." will match a single ".", "\\" a single "\" etc.)|

For example, a basic expressionlist to allow access (if placed in the whitelist) to the Azure portal and some Azure features: 

`.*\.azure\.net`

`.*\.azure\.com`

`.*\.core\.windows\.net`
