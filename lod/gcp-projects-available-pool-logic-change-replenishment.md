# Google Cloud Platform: Projects Available Pool Logic Change: Replenishment

We are excited to announce a new enhancement to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Projects Available Pool logic, aimed at improving the user experience and optimizing project availability. With this update, the replenishment process has been introduced to ensure a continuous supply of projects in the pool, enabling a "rolling" number of available projects for our valued lab users.

This release focuses on improving the user experience and resource management for GCP labs. By implementing automatic project replenishment and testing project deletion, lab users can seamlessly continue their work without interruption. The rolling number of available projects ensures a consistent supply, enabling efficient lab usage and reducing administrative overhead.

## Overview

Previously, when lab users completed a GCP lab and their project was deleted, the available projects would gradually deplete over time. However, we have listened to your feedback and implemented a new strategy that automatically creates a new project in the subscription pool, ensuring a consistent number of projects are always available for our users.

## Key Benefits

1.  Continuous Availability: The replenishment feature ensures that lab users will always have a sufficient number of available projects to complete their tasks without delays.
1.  Improved User Experience: With the rolling number of projects, users can seamlessly transition from one lab to another, without waiting for project allocation or encountering project shortages.

## How It Works

1.  Upon completing a GCP lab and having your project deleted, the replenishment process will automatically kick in.
1.  The system will identify the depleted project and initiate the creation of a new project to replace it in the available projects pool.
1.  The new project will be provisioned and added to the pool, ready for allocation to the next lab user.

## Note

1.  Project Deletion: Please note that project deletion will still occur once a lab user completes their tasks. However, with the replenishment feature, a new project will be created immediately, ensuring a seamless experience for subsequent users.
1.  Availability Monitoring: We continuously monitor project availability to ensure an adequate number of projects are available in the pool. In case of any unforeseen issues, our team will promptly resolve them to maintain a consistent supply.

We are confident that this enhancement will significantly improve your GCP lab experience, ensuring a smooth workflow and minimizing any disruptions caused by project shortages.
