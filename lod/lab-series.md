# Lab Series

Lab Profiles in Lab on Demand (LOD) can be housed in a lab Series. The Lab Series contains Lab Profiles and settings for the Lab Series.

The lab profile is where the settings are configured for the lab. These settings include (but are not limited to): Name, owning organization, expected duration, resource requirements, virtual machines, network configuration, and much more. Lab profiles can exist on their own or they can be part of a Lab Series that contains multiple lab profiles. 

To create a Lab series, click **Create Lab Series** on the Lab Series tile, on the LOD Site Administration page.

1. **# of Training Days**: The expected number of days for end users to use any of the lab profiles within the lab series. This does not restrict users from using labs after the expected number of days, it is used to determine resources consumption of the labs.

1. **Enabled**: Check this box to enable the Lab Series. If this box is left unchecked, the Lab Series will not be available to users.

## Limits

1. **Max RAM Usage**: The maximum amount of RAM that can be used in the Lab Series, across all lab launches. Once this limit is reached, users will not be able to launch labs until another user closes their lab.


1. **Max Active Instances**: The maximum amount of lab instances that can be launched from the Lab Series. Once this limit is reached, users will not be able to launch labs until another user closes their lab.

1. **Max Instances Per Lab Per User (Retakes)**: This allows the number of retakes or relaunches via API, to be limited to a specific number of launches. Once the limit has been reached per lab, per user, an error will be returned in the API call. Additionally, you can restrict the scope of time that the user can relaunch labs within, in the _Days_ field.

    If a user is assigned a Lab Series Assignment, the number of relaunches or retakes will be reset back to 0, for that lab and that user.

## Publish

For organizations that have proprietary content, an option is available to designate a person to have the permission to publish a lab series to the respective API consumer. After an organization designates someone to publish to their API, future requests to LODS to publish a lab series will be a billable service. Permission to publish to the API consumer will be provided on-request from an administrator of the organization. 

1. Select the API Consumer to publish the Lab Series to. This will allow the lab profiles aligned with this lab series to be available for consumption via the chosen API.
