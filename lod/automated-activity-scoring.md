# Automated Activity Scoring

## Scoring

Scoring allows the student to be given a score for each Activity they complete correctly, and those scores contribute to the student's overall score in the lab. As the lab author, you set the passing score for the lab after you enable scoring in the lab. 

> [!KNOWLEDGE] When Scoring is enabled, it is not required to make each question scored. As a lab author, you are free to decide which Activities have a score value associated, and only score the questions that you wish to.

To enable Scoring in your lab:

1. Click the **Activities icon** to enter the settings menu for Activities.

1. Click the **switch** to enable Scoring. 

1. Enter a **passing score** for the lab. You may change this at anytime, as often as you would like.

1. Click the checkbox to enable scoring, and enter a score for that Activity.

1. The student will be given the score value upon completing the Activity correctly. 

## Partial Scoring

Partial scoring allows the student to be given a partial score, for activities where they do not complete 100% of the activity correctly. The partial score will contribute to the overall score in the lab. 

For example, if the activity was to check if a student created a directory with a specific name, in a specific location, but the student did not name the directory correctly but did save it in the correct location -- the student could receive credit for saving in the correct location, even though they did not name the directory correctly.
