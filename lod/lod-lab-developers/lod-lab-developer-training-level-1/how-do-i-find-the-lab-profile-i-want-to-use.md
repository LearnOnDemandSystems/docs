4. Set the qualifiers and values in the filters you need.

![KNOWLEDGE] You can optionally click Output Options on the right side below the filters and check the output columns you want displayed in the results. Several of the Output Options are preselected for you. You can add or remove them as needed by clicking the X to the right of any filter to remove it.
