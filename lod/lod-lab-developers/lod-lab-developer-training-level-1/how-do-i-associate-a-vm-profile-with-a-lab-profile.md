# How do I associate a VM Profile with a Lab Profile?

For a virtual machine to be used in a launched lab, the VHD must be in a Virtual Machine Profile that is associated with the Lab Profile. This association is done from within the Lab Profile page.

To do this:
1. On the **Site Administration** under **Lab Profiles**, click **Find Lab Profiles**. 
1. On the **Find Lab Profiles** page in the **Series Name** field, input the series name and click **Search**. 
1. In the search results, click the name of the **Lab Profile** you want. 
1. On the **Lab Profile** page, click the **Edit** link and then click the **Virtual Machines** tab. 
1. Click the Add **Virtual Machine** link and in the **Choose Virtual Machine Profile** dialog box. 
1. Click the **Search** button. All of the Virtual Machine Profiles that are associated with that series will be listed. 
1. Select all of the **Virtual Machine Profile(s)** that will be used in this **Lab Profile** and click **OK**. 
1. Make any changes to the default choices for each machine as needed such as **Startup delay**. 
1. If there is more than one VM, make sure the first VM the user will need to interact with is marked as the **Default selection**, then click **Save**.
