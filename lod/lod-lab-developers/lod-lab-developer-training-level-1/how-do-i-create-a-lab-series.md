## How Do I Create A Lab Series?

A Lab Series is the identifier for all the pieces in your lab(s) and is a required component. Because of this, you create it first.

Once you are logged in: 
1. Go to Site Administration and under Lab Series click **Create Lab Series**. 
1. Input a **Name** and the **# Training Days** (if known) and then click **Save**.

For LOD lab component terminology and guidelines for building Lab Series and Lab Profiles, please read the [LOD Terminology and Guidelines for Building a Lab article](lod-terminology-and-guidelines-for-building-a-lab.md).
