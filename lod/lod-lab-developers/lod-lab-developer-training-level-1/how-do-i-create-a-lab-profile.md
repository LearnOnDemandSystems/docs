## How Do I Create A Lab Profile?

A Lab Profile is used to provide the lab interface, the virtual machines, and other items used in the lab to the user. A Lab Profile is a required component of all labs.

For LOD lab component terminology and guidelines for building Lab Series and Lab Profiles, please read the [LOD Terminology and Guidelines for Building a Lab article](lod-terminology-and-guidelines-for-building-a-lab.md).

There are two locations to create a Lab Profile: 

- From the Lab Series page you want to add the Lab Profile to (automatically associates the Lab Profile to the series) 

- From the Admin page on the Lab Profile tab (not automatically associated with any Lab Series). This blog will be from the Lab Series page.

Once you are logged in:
1. Navigate to the Lab Series page.
1. Click **Create Lab Profile** in the link bar towards the top of the page. 
1. The profile will open to the **Basic Information** tab with the following fields.

|Field|Req.|Type of Information|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Number|Y|Number to order the Lab Profile within the series|
|Name|Y|Name of lab|
|Series|Y|Automatically filled in from the Lab Series where the process stared|

|Language|Y|Language the lab uses|

|Objective|N|Place for the objectives of the lab; if filled out, seen in a window when the lab first launches|
|Scenario|N|Place for the scenario of the lab; if filled out, seen in the same window as the objectives|

### The fields and checkboxes at the bottom will be covered in later articles and videos.
