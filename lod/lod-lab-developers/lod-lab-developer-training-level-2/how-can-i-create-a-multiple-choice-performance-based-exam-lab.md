# How can I create a multiple-choice performance-based exam lab?

You can now create a lab which is a performance-based exam. This gives you the ability to set multiple choice questions alongside virtual machines that the student can use to determine the answers. 

- Questions can all be on one page or grouped on different pages. 
- Users will access and launch the Exam lab the same way as a regular lab. 
- When they have finished the exam, they will close it and select whether to submit it for grading. 
- The grading is fully automated. Results are tracked and displayed in the Lab Instance details page as well as within the lab instance search results; this also provides export options.
