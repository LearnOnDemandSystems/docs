# How do I create a folder structure for my images?

You may create multiple folders and subfolders in the main folder(s) in storage to organize your resources. All folders can be renamed and subfolders can be moved around. Empty folders can be deleted. Those topics will be covered in later blogs and videos.

To create a folder in storage:
1. From the **Site Administration** page, click **Manage Storage**. 
1. On the Storage page, double-click the primary storage folder. 
1. Click the Create Folder link on the right side of the screen. 
1. In the Folder Name field, enter the folder?s name and click OK.
    - You can add more folders at the same level using the **Create Folder** link. 
    - You can also create sub-folders inside one of your folders by opening the folder and then using the **Create Folder** link.
