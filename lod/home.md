## Authoring lab instructions

- [**IDLx Activities**](/lod/activities.md) - Activities fall into two broad categories: Questions and Automated. Questions are simply multiple choice or short answer questions. Automated Activities have a script configured to run against a cloud subscription or Windows-based virtual machines running on Hyper-V in the lab.

- [**IDLx Authoring Guide**](/guides/idl2/idlv2-authoring-guide-and-best-practice.md) - This document covers Markdown, lab instruction editor interface, uploading files into your lab, and many other topics to assist with authoring your IDLx lab.

- [**IDLx Instruction Editor Overview**](/lod/idlx-lab-instruction-editor.md) - This document is an overview of the lab instruction editor, and an explanation of the various functions available.
