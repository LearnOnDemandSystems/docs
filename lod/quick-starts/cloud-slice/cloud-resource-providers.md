# Cloud Resource Providers

> [!ALERT] You are currently viewing the seventh entry in a series of Quick Starts about Cloud Slice.

> This guide is **optional**, but it is recommended so that your lab will have all the necessary resources available when students launch your Cloud Slice lab.
>
> To complete this quick start, you must have the following:
> * a cloud subscription configured for use with the One Learn Lab on Demand platform (LOD);
>
> * a Cloud Subscription Pool created in LOD that contains the cloud subscription(s) you will use with your Cloud Slice;
>
> * a lab profile that is properly configured to be a Cloud Slice lab;
>
> If you have not yet configured your cloud subscription for use with LOD, go through the [Configure Subscription Quick Start](configure-subscription.md).
>
> If you have configured your cloud subscription properly but have not added your subscription into LOD for use with Cloud Slice labs, go through the [Add Subscription into LOD Quick Start](add-subscription-into-lod.md)
>
> If you have not yet configured your lab profile to be a Cloud Slice lab, go through the [Creating a Cloud Slice lab Quick Start](create.md)
