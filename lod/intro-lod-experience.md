# Introduction to the Lab on Demand Experience

## Admin

The Lab on Demand Admin page consists of several tiles. Each tile contains links to accomplish tasks related to the same topic. For example, the Lab Profiles tile only contains links to tasks related to a Lab Profile. 

### Tiles 
The tiles on the Admin page can be moved and re-ordered any way you would like. To move a tile, simply left-click and drag to the position on the Admin page where you would like the tile to be located. 

Tiles contain links that are relevant to the name of the tile. Links on the tiles include, but are not limited to:

- **Find links**: used to find items relevant to the name of the tile. For example, the Find Lab Profile link on the Lab Profiles tile is used to find Lab Profiles that are already created in Lab on Demand. 

- **Create links**: used to create items relevant to the name of the tile. For example, the Create a Virtual Machine tile on the Virtual Machines tile is used to create new Virtual Machine Profile.

Optionally, you can create new items from the respective Find page. After you click a Find link, there will be a Create link in the upper-right corner. 

>[!KNOWLEDGE] If a tile does not have a Find or Create link, click a link for the item you wish to find or create, on the tile. For example, the Cloud Services tile does not contain Find or Create links. If you wish to find or create a new Cloud Subscription, click the Cloud Subscriptions link. The next page will allow you to Find Cloud Subscriptions, and a Create link will be located in the upper-right corner.
