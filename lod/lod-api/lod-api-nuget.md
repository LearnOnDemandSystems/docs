# Lab on Demand API v3.0

## Production API and Integration Testing

Only lab profiles with a development status of **Complete** are consumable  via API. 

Development/Integration Testing API available with all the same API calls your production API can make, but has the following settings:
- Max Active Lab Instances - 5
- Max Saved Labs per User - 1
- Max Active Lab Instances per user - 1
- Max lab duration - 30 minutes
- Allows launching of lab profiles with any Development Status
    - i.e. is not restricted to a _Complete_ development status
- Has a dedicated API key
- Does not generate billable events

## API Request Format

Requests are not case sensitive. Requests can use either **GET** or **POST**. 

A typical API request will look like:

`https://labondemand.com/api/v3/[method]?[parameters]`

For example, a request to get the entire lab catalog will look like:

`https://labondemand.com/api/v3/catalog`

## API Key
- All methods require an API key, which must be obtained from Learn on Demand Systems. This key is used by Lab on Demand to validate your account. The key can be passed as an HTTP request header with the header name "api_key".

## API Response Format

All responses are formatted as JSON. A full explanation of each response is included with each command below.

## Date Formats

All dates are in unix epoch time, which is the number of seconds that have elapsed since midnight UTC January 1st, 1970. Values are always rounded to the nearest whole second.

## API Client
A .NET API client library is available via Nuget. This will allow you to use the API using only .NET code. 

https://www.nuget.org/packages/LearnOnDemandSystems.OneLearnLOD.OneLearnLODAPIClient/ 

Example:

```
var apiUrl = "https://labondemand.com/api/v3";
var apiKey = "YourKeyGoesHere";
var labId = 12001; 
var firstName = "Sample";
var lastName = "Student";
var userId = "sample.student@nowhere.net"; // you can use any value that will uniquely identify the user in your system. here, we use an email address.
var email = "sample.student@nowhere.net";

var client = new LabOnDemandApiClient(apiUrl, apiKey);
var launchResponse = client.Launch(labId, userId, firstName, lastName, email);

if (launchResponse.Result == LaunchResult.Success)
{
    var url = launchResponse.Url; //this is the URL to send the user to
}
else
{
    var error = launchResponse.Error; //this will explain what went wrong
}
```
