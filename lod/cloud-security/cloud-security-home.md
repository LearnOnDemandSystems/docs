# Cloud Security

Cloud Slice Labs can come with unique security challenges. Learn On Demand Systems is dedicated to providing developers with tools to protect their cloud environments from abuse while still maintaining the flexibility to create whatever environment your lab requires. 

The following documents outline our approach to cloud security, how the security review process fits into lab development, and best practices for how to create a secure cloud lab.

### [Cloud Security Reviews](./cloud-security-review.md)
Labs that use cloud orchestration require a **Cloud Security Review** before they are available outside Lab On Demand.

### [Cloud Security Standards](./cloud-security-standards.md)
Outlines how risk level is determined and criteria for a lab passing security review.

### [How to Create an Access Control Policy](../create-a-restriction-policy.md)
How to find or create an appropriate Access Control Policy and add it to your lab.
