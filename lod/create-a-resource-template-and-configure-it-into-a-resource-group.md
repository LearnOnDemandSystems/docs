# Create a Resource Template and Configure it into a Resource Group

In the OneLearn Lab on Demand platform (LOD), a Resource Group contains resource templates, restriction policies, and portal user permissions. This document covers creating a Resource template and configuring it into a Resource Group. If you have not created a Restriction Policy or would like to create one, see our guide on [creating a Restriction Policy](create-a-restriction-policy.md).

1. Check or uncheck the **Deploy in Background** checkbox.

    > [!KNOWLEDGE] When you do not mark a Cloud Resource Template as deploy in background, the lab will not be available to the student once launched until the resources defined in the Cloud Resource Template are fully provisioned. If your lab provisions resources that are not required at the beginning of the lab, you may want to check this checkbox so that the lab launches more quickly,allowing students to start working in the lab even while resources are being provisioned.
