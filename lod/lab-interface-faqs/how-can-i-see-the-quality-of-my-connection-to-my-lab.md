# How Can I See The Quality Of My Connection To My Lab?

If you are experiencing issues in your lab such as, **slow response time**, **lag in typing**, or **disconnections** you should check the quality of your internet connection to the lab servers. This information will let you know if there is something happening with your connection and will assist the help desk in identifying a possible cause.

There are two places within your lab to find information on your connection; 
- **The top right side of the lab interface near the Commands menu at the top right of the lab interface:** 

    Here you can see a visual representation using the ubiquitous “how many bars you got?” graphic of your connection at that very moment. It will look like several bars in increasing size. The more bars that are lit, the better your connection is at that moment. You can hover over it to see a summary of your connection quality and latency.

- **For more detailed information on your connection click the Support tab on the right side of your launched lab.**

    The graphic is displayed larger here, as well as the current **Quality** rating (excellent, good, OK, poor) and the **Latency** value. This measures the network latency between your browser and the server where the VMs are hosted. This is the last latency value received from the your machine. **Large latency numbers may cause your lab to seem sluggish or even non-responsive**. The issue may be with your network, internet provider, the overall internet health, or the lab host. If any of the conditions persist, contact your help desk and provide them with this detailed information along with the **Support Information on the Support** tab.

>[!knowledge] 
>- <= 60 milliseconds = Excellent (4 bars)
>- <= 150 milliseconds = Good (3 bars)
>- <= 240 milliseconds = OK (2 bars)
>- \> 240 milliseconds = Poor (1 bars)

You can also check your ports and internet speed to our servers using the **Trouble with your test lab?** link in the Training Management System. These comprehensive tests will show your actual connection latency and bandwidth (not just speed) to our servers. This information can be very valuable in helping you improve the performance your internet connection and is needed by the technical support teams.
