## Is There A Way To Show Lab Content In A Separate Window?

You can customize your lab workspace by moving all integrated IDLx content into a separate browser window. This window will contain all the lab content. This is especially useful if you have multiple monitors. The two windows communicate with each other, so all actions (machine switching, media loading, etc.) work just like they normally do. 

## To Separate Content In Another Window

1. Click the hamburger menu in the upper-right corner of the lab interface. 

1. Select **Split Windows**.

    This will move the lab content; instructions, images, links, code blocks, etc into a new window. This window can be sized and positioned however you would like. 

1. When you want to **merge the lab interface back into one window**, click the hamburger menu in the upper-right corner of the window that contains the lab instructions.

1. Select **Join Windows**.
