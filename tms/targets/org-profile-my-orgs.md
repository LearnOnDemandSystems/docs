# Targeted Help for the My Organizations and Organization Profile pages

The My Organizations page is a quick way to access to the Profile page for any organization you manage including child organizations in one place. Depnding on several factors, there may also be links under each organization to its calendars for classes, rooms, and instructors and the attendance chart.  

The Organization Profile page provides information for one organization. It has a menu bar of links for associated pages and actions, including the links that are on the My Organizations page. These links will vary for each organization depending on how it has been setup and your permissions. 

The following are articles related to actions that can be done from either of these pages:

- [How can I see classes in a calendar view?](../tms-administrators/classes/schedule/see-classes-in-calendar-view.md)
- [How do I set the defaults for creating users and classes?](../tms-administrators/tms-fundamentals/set-defaults-for-creating-users-and-classes.md)
- [How can my organization be set up to use contract instructors?](../tms-administrators/users/instructor-management/set-up-organization-to-use-contract-instructors.md)
- [How can I check students in for class?](../tms-administrators/classes/enrollments-rosters/check-in-students-for-class.md)
