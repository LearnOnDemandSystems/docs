# How can my students access Skillpipe courseware from their class enrollment?

Your students can easily access their Skillpipe courseware through a single sign-on from their TMS enrollment page. When a student is enrolled in a Microsoft Official Curriculum (MOC) class, an **Access Courseware** button will become visible. This button will appear only for students who are **Enrolled** in the class and only after the start time on the first day of class. Once class starts, enrolled students may have to refresh their page to see the **Access Courseware** button.

When your student clicks this button the first time, they will be taken to either the **Authorization Request** page or the **Registration** page for Skillpipe. If the student's TMS account has the same primary email address as their Skillpipe account, on the **Authorization Request** page, they will:
1. Enter their Skillpipe **password**
1. Click **Authorize Access** to authorize **OneLearn TMS** to access to their Skillpipe account.

The student will be taken to their bookshelf in their Skillpipe account. Subsequent times when the student clicks **Access Courseware**, they will be taken directly to their Skillpipe bookshelf without having to sign in.

Please note: This feature only allows stduents to easily access their courseware in their Skillpipe account through single sign-on from the TMS enrollment page. To manage and make changes to their Skillpipe account itself, they will need to use Skillpipe directly.

If the student's TMS profile email address is not the same as the email aligned to their Skillpipe account, the **Access Courseware** button will take them to Skillpipeâ€™s **Registration** page. 
- Students who do not have a Skillpipe account can create a new account from the **Registration** page.
- Students who already have a Skillpipe account can login into their account by selecting the **Already have an account?** option. 
- Once in their Skillpipe account, the student can add a course and enter their courseware code to redeem their courseware.

This feature is enabled at the Organization level. Once enabled on your organization, all enrollments with a status of Enrolled  that are aligned with MOC courses will have the **Access Courseware** button. If you are not interested in using this feature and would like to disable it, please submit a support ticket at [**https://lod.one/help**](https://lod.one/help) requesting that it be disabled for your organization.
