# What is the difference between launching a lab and saving and resuming a lab?

Launching a lab starts a new lab instance. When you first access your labs, you launch the labs by clicking the **Launch** button in the **Class** activities. 

Saving a lab allows you to reopen that lab instance from the point at which you stopped without losing any of the work you have done. To save a lab, click **Exit** and choose **Save and Close Lab**. Please note: the expiration date and time of your saved instance is displayed when saving. It is best practice to save your lab instance at the end of the day.

Resuming the lab starts the saved lab instance exactly where you stopped working. To reopen the saved lab instance, click the **Resume** button. Saved labs can be reopened from your **My Training** page or from the **Class** activities.

When closing a lab, you may click **Exit** and **Cancel** to close the lab instance without saving your work. You will not be able to **Resume** the lab but can start a new lab instance at the beginning by clicking **Launch**.
