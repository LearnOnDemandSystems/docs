# How and when can students access labs?

You can set up your classes at any time in the TMS. However, students cannot access the labs until the first class session begins.

Student access to labs is based on several factors in the TMS:
- The student must have an enrollment in the class.
- The Enrollment Status must be set to Enrolled.
- The first session of class has started.

When student register using **Training Keys**, they are automatically added as **Enrolled** in the class.

To access their class and labs, students will:
1. Log into **https://alh.learnondemand.net**. They will land on their **Current Training** page. This page will display all their current enrollments as well as any saved labs they may have.
1. Click the **name** of the class to open their enrollment.
1. Scroll to the **Activities** section where the labs are listed. Prior to class start, a countdown timer message shows when the labs will become available.
1. After class starts, click the **Launch** button under each lab to start it. 

If a student does not see the **Launch** button on the labs after class has begun, please try the following:
- Have them refresh their browser.
- Have them log out and back in. 
- Verify the **Enrollment Status** for the student on the class **Roster** is **Enrolled**.

If there are still access issues, contact our Help Desk by clicking the **Contact** button on the top of any page in the TMS for contact methods.

After class starts, the labs can be launched, saved, and resumed through the end of class and an additional 180 days after class.
