# What can I do if a student needs to reschedule or cancel a class?

In some cases, you may need to reschedule a student who cannot attend the class they are registered for. If a student registration needs to be rescheduled, the best practice is to first cancel the student’s enrollment. This will open up the seat in the class and the training key can then be used by a different student in the class.

To cancel a student:
1. Navigate to the **Class** page.
1. Click **Roster**. The Roster shows all students currently registered for the class and their status.
1. Select the **Enrollment** dropdown menu next to the student's name and choose **Cancelled**.
1. Click **Save Changes**.

Cancelling a student will free up the previously assigned seat in the class for a replacement student; it does not return the voucher used for the seat to be used in another class. If you do not have a replacement student and would like to use the voucher for another class, you will need to contact our Support team at **support@learnondemandsystems.com**. We can return the key to the pool for you to use in a different class. Please make sure to include the student’s name and class they are no longer attending.

As an Operations Manager, you will only be able to cancel a student enrollment if the class has not started. Once a class has started, you will need to contact our Support team at **support@learnondemandsystems.com**. If the student has not launched any labs, we will be able to cancel their enrollment.
