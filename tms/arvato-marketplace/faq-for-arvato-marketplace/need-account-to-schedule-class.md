# I don't have a user account or permissions to set up a class, what should I do?

Need to schedule a class but don't have permissions? First, you will need a user account in the TMS if you do not already have one. Your organization's **Operations Manager** can create the account for you. Once you have an account, you also need the following added to your account to schedule a class: the **Operations Manager** role and **Organization Management** over your organization.

You can also submit a ticket at [**https://lod.one/help**](https://lod.one/help) if you need us to create the account for you. Please provide us with your name, email, and the organization you are with.
