# Why do I receive a message that the email is taken when I try to create a user account?

At times, you may receive an error stating **Sorry, this e-mail address is taken** while creating a user account. This message means there is already a user account in the TMS associated with the email address you are trying to use. If this happens, please submit a Support ticket at [**https://lod.one/help**](https://lod.one/help). We can give you the access needed to schedule the instructor or we can set up a student enrollment for you.

You may also speak with the instructor or student to determine if they would like a new user account created under your organization. To do this, they will need to provide a different email address that isn’t already associated with an account in our system. You can then create a new user account for them using the new email.
