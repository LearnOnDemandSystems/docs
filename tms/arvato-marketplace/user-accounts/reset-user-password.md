# How do I, as an Administrative user, reset a user's password?

If you have the Operations Manager role, you have the ability to reset the password of student and instructor accounts belonging to your organization.

To reset a user’s password:
1. Navigate to the user’s **Profile** page. 
1. On the **Profile** page, click **Change Password**. The Change Password link has an icon of a lock and is at the top of the user’s profile, next to the Edit option. 
1. In the dialog that opens, enter a password of your choice in the **New Password** and **Confirm Password** fields.

   > Passwords must be at least 8 characters.

1. Click **OK**. 
1. Click **OK** to close the dialog stating that your password was successfully changed.
1. To ensure that the user is prompted to change their password, click **Edit** on the user’s **Profile**. 
1. Check the **This user must change their password on next logon** check box and click **Save.**

The student will not be notified when their password is changed. Therefore, please inform the student their new login credentials.

> [!Note] You will not be able to reset a password for a user logging into the TMS through an outside authentication such as Google or Microsoft Live. 

If you experience any issues resetting a user’s password, please submit a Support ticket at [**https://lod.one/help**](https://lod.one/help) for assistance with the password reset.
