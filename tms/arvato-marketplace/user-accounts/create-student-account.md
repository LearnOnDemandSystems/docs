# How do I create an account for a student?

Students must have accounts in the TMS to be enrolled in classes to access their labs. You can manually create these accounts for your students.

To create a user account:
1. Click **Admin** to open the **Admin** menu or navigate to **Site Administration**. 
1. Under **Users**, Click **Create User**.
1. Fill in the required **Basic Information**:
    - **First Name**
    - **Last Name**
    - **Primary Email**
    - **Username**
    - **Password** and **Confirm Password**
1. Click **Save**.

Students will need to be provided their User credentials and directed to log into their account at https://alh.learnondemand.net. Once a student logs in, they are taken to their Current Training page, which lists their class by name. Clicking on the class name gives them access to their labs.
