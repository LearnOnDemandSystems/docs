# How do I create an Instructor account?

Need to set up your instructors in the TMS? You may either create a new user account for the instructor or modify an existing user to become an instructor. 

## Create New Instructor

To set up a new Instructor account:
1. On the **Admin** menu, in the **Instructor** group, click **Create Instructor**. 
1. On the **Basic Information** tab of the **Create User** page, fill in the user’s required information -
     - **First Name**
     - **Last Name**
     - **Primary Email**
     - **User Name**
     - **Password**
1. Click **Save**.
     
The Instructor role will automatically be applied. Please provide the new instructor with their login credentials.

## Modify Existing User

If the user already has an account within your organization, you will modify their account to designate them as an instructor. To do this:
1.  From the **Admin** menu, in the **Users** group, click **Find Users**.
1. Input the user's **Name** and click **Search**. 
1. Select the user in the search results. 
1. Click **Edit**
1. Select the **Roles** tab and click **+ Assign Role**. 
1. This will open the Choose User Role dialog box. Select the **Instructor** role and click **OK**. 
1. Click **Save** to finalize the changes. 

If the user is already logged in, they may need to log out of their account and log back in for the changes to take effect.
