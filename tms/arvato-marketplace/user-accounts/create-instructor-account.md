     - **Last Name**
     - **Primary Email**
     - **User Name**
     - **Password**
1. Click **Save**.
     
The Instructor role will automatically be applied. Please provide the new instructor with their login credentials.

## Modify Existing User

If the user already has an account within your organization, you will modify their account to designate them as an instructor. To do this:
1.  From the **Admin** menu, in the **Users** group, click **Find Users**.
1. Input the user's **Name** and click **Search**. 
1. Select the user in the search results.
