# How do I set up another user to schedule classes?

You can set up additional users to be class schedulers in your TMS organization. These users, either new or existing, will need the Operations Manager role. 

## Create New Operations Manager

To set up a new Operations Manager account:
1. Click **Admin** to open the **Admin** menu, and in the **Users** group, click **Create User**.

     - **Last Name**
     - **Primary Email**
     - **User Name**
     - **Password**
1. Click the **Roles** tab and click **+ Assign Role**.
1. This will open the Choose User Role dialog box. Select the **Operations Manager – Subscription Centers** role and click **OK**.
1. Click the **Organization Management** tab and check the box next to your organization's name.
1. Click **Save**.
     
Please provide the new Operations Manager with their login credentials.

## Modify Existing User

If the user already has an account within your organization, you will modify their account to designate them as an instructor. To do this:
1.  On the **Admin** menu, in the **Users** group, click **Find Users**.
1. Input the user's **Name** and click **Search**. 
1. Select the user in the search results.

If the user is already logged in, they may need to log out of their account and log back in for the changes to take effect.
