# How do I add more students to a class I have already created?

There may be times when you need to add more students into a class. If you want to increase the capacity of a scheduled class, you must have unused class vouchers available. The class must match the new vouchers' course.

To increase the number of students you can enroll into class:
1. On the **Admin** menu in the **Classes** group, click **Find Classes**.
1. If the class has already started, remove the **Starts in the Future** filter. 
1. Click **Search** and click on the class name in the search results to open the class profile. 
1. Click **Class Training Keys**. 
1. Look for **Add Class Vouchers**. You will only see this link if you have matching vouchers available.
1. This opens a popup window to input the number of vouchers you would like to add. Input the number and click **OK** to increase the number of enrollments permitted in your class. 

You will see new training keys available to distribute to your students to self-register and self-enroll into class or you may manually create the user accounts and enrollments.
