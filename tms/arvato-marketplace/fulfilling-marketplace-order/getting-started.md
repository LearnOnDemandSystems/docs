# I just purchased labs from LoDS. How do I get started?

The Learn on Demand Systemsâ€™ Training Management System (TMS) syncs with the Courseware Marketplace using your Arvato Customer Number when you purchase labs. The TMS gives you everything you need to manage your labs as well as your learning and training programs.

## New Customers

When you have placed your first order with LoDS, you will need to create an organization and user account in TMS for the vouchers from the Courseware Marketplace to sync. To create your organization, you will need your **Arvato Customer Number**. Then:
1. Go to **https://alh.learnondemand.net/Organization/Register/2069**.
1. Fill in your contact information as well as your organization information. Your **Arvato Customer Number** is required to synchronize your purchase to the TMS.
1. Click **Register** to continue.

A Welcome page is provided to help with the next steps. There is also more information in the **Related Articles** section below.

## Returning Customers

As a returning customer, you already have an organization set up in the TMS. You do not need to create a new organization to access your vouchers and set up your classes for labs. Your vouchers are automatically sync'd from the Courseware Marketplace and loaded into the TMS. It may take up to 10 minutes for the sync to occur. Simply:
1. Go to **https://alh.learnondemand.net** and click **Sign In**.
1. Enter your **Username** and **Password** and click **Sign In**.
