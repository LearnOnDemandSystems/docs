# How do I enroll students in a class?

Two different methods are available for setting up your students. You may either issue **training keys**, which allows them to self-register, and self-enroll into class or you can **set up your students' user accounts and enrollments** for them directly in the TMS platform.

## Student Self-Enrollment with Training Keys
The simplest method of enrolling students into a class is to have your students self-register into the class by providing them with training keys. 

To use training keys:
1. Navigate to the **Class** page and click the **Class Training Keys** link. This will open a list of the class vouchers and Training Keys. 
1. Export or copy the training keys from this column. Each student will need one of these unique keys to self-enroll. 
1. Send the training keys to the students with the the following instructions to assist with their self-registration:
    1. Go to **https://alh.learnondemand.net**
    1. If you are a first time user-
        1. Click **Register with Training Key**.
        1. Input your training key in the **Register with a Training Key** field.
        1. Click **Register**.
        1. This opens the registration page to create a user account. Input your registration information and click **Save**. Your enrollment will then open.
    1. If you are a returning user-
        1. Click **Sign In**.
        1. Input your **Username** and **Password** and click **Sign In**.
        1. You will be taken to your Current Training page. Click **Redeem Training Key**.
        1. Input your training key and click **Redeem Training Key**. This opens your enrollment.
    1. Please launch a test lab to check for connectivity issues and to familiarize yourself with the lab interface. Once class starts, the Launch buttons will appear beside the labs.
    1. For assistance anytime, click **Contact** on the TMS website or click here, **https://alh.learnondemand.net/Home/Contact** to go to the page now.

## Manual Enrollment
You can create enrollments manually for your students for the class. If your students do not have an user account yet, you will need to create one for them (see [How do I create a student account?](../user-accounts/create-student-account.md)).

To add students to a class:
1. Navigate to the **Class** page.
1. Click the **Roster** link.
1. Click **Add Students**.
1. Choose all the students you would like to enroll and then click **OK**.

Students must be in the **Enrolled** status to be able to launch their labs. They will not be given access to launch labs until the class starts. You may cancel a student up until the class begins.

Students will need to be provided their User credentials and directed to log into their account at **https://alh.learnondemand.net**. Once a student logs in, they are taken to their Current Training page, which lists their class by name. Clicking on the class name gives them access to their labs.
