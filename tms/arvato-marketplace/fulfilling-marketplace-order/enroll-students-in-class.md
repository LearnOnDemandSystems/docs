# How do I enroll students in a class?

Two different methods are available for setting up your students. You may either issue **training keys**, which allows them to self-register, and self-enroll into class or you can **set up your students' user accounts and enrollments** for them directly in the TMS platform.

## Student Self-Enrollment with Training Keys
The simplest method of enrolling students into a class is to have your students self-register into the class by providing them with training keys. 

To use training keys:
1. Navigate to the **Class** page and click the **Class Training Keys** link. This will open a list of the class vouchers and Training Keys.

*Select the Class Training Keys link*

2. Export or copy the training keys from this column. Each student will need one of these unique keys to self-enroll.

3. Send the training keys to the students with the the following instructions to assist with their self-registration:

    1. If you are a first time user-
        1. Click **Register with Training Key**.

## Manual Enrollment
You can create enrollments manually for your students for the class. If your students do not have an user account yet, you will need to create one for them (see [How do I create a student account?](../user-accounts/create-student-account.md)).

To add students to a class:
1. Navigate to the **Class** page.
2. Click the **Roster** link.

![](/tms/images/cwm-roster-link.png)
*Select the Roster link*

3. Click **Add Students**.

![](/tms/images/cwm-add-students-roster.png)
*Select the Add Students link*

4. Choose all the students you would like to enroll and then click **OK**.

*Select the students for your class*

5. Click **Save Changes** button.

*Save your changes*

Students must be in the **Enrolled** status to be able to launch their labs. They will not be given access to launch labs until the class starts. You may cancel a student up until the class begins.

Students will need to be provided their User credentials and directed to log into their account at **https://alh.learnondemand.net**. Once a student logs in, they are taken to their Current Training page, which lists their class by name. Clicking on the class name gives them access to their labs.
