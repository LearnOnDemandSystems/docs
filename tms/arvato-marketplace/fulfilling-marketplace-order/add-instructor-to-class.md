# How do I add an instructor to a class?

You can add an instructor to a class when you are creating or editing a class. You may need to **create the instructor** user account, however, if the instructor already has a user account in the TMS, you may simply **add them** to the class.

## Create an Instructor from a Class
On the **Create Class/Edit Class** page:
1. Expand the **Instructors** section.
1. Click **Create Instructor**. This opens the Create User page in a new tab.
    1. Input the user's information; required fields are:
         - **First Name**
         - **Last Name**
         - **Primary Email Address**. Note: If you receive a message that the email address is already in use, then a user account already exists for the instructor. In this case, follow the instructions for **Add Instructor**.
         - **Username**
         - **Password/Confirm Password**
    1. **Save** the user account. The instructor role is automatically added when the user is created from the Instructor section.
    1. Return to the **Create/Edit Class** tab in your browser to add the instructor to the class.

## Add an Instructor to a Class

On the **Create Class/Edit Class** page:

1. Click **Add Instructor**.
1. Input the instructor's name and click **Search**.
1. Select the instructor in the search results and click **OK**.

## Provide Instructor Access

You do not need to purchase a lab for the instructor. As soon as the class is set up and the instructor is added, they can access the labs from the Class page to prepare for class.

Send the instructor the class information and the following instructions to access the class and labs. If you created them an account send them their **Username** and **Password** as well:
1. Log into **https://alh.learnondemand.net** with your username and password.
1. Click **My Calendar** at the top of the page.
1. Navigate to the date for the **first day** of class and click the **class name**. This opens the Class Details page. This is where you will go to teach the class.
    1. You may launch the **Test Lab** to become familiar with the lab interface.
1. Scroll to the **Activities** section and click **Launch** beside any lab to open it.
1. For technical assistance with labs, click the **Contact** button at the top of any page and use one of the methods provided to request assistance.

For additional information on using the lab interface and preparing for class, please read the articles for [Instructors](/tms/home.md).
