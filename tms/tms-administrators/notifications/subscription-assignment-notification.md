# How do I create a subscription assignment notification?

Automated notifications are a way to notify students, instructors and staff when something changes in the TMS. Most notifications are triggered based on an action taken in the platform, but we also have time triggers for enrollments, classes and course assignments. Using notifications can save you a significant amount of time because you will not need to email people with updates.

Please keep in mind, all users have the right to opt out of notifications. Even though a notification is sent out by the platform it does not mean that the email will be received by the user.

*Overview of the process of creating a notification*

## Preparation for creating a notification
Take some time to answer the following questions for each notification you want to create. 

1. What action triggers a notification?
1. Who is the user completing the action triggering the notification?
1. Who are the user(s) receiving the notification?
1. A valid email address to display in the “From” line of the notification
1. Subject for the email notification
1. Text for the email you are sending through the notification

## Select a trigger event
The Trigger Event is an action in the platform causing a notification to be sent out. In most cases this is an action that is taken in the platform, like changing an enrollment status from Enrolled to Cancelled, then when the enrollment is saved it triggers the notification to be sent. A time trigger is also available based on when a class begins and ends or when a course assignment is set to expire. 

One or more trigger events may be used. When multiple triggers are in place a notification is sent when any of the event triggers are met. After choosing the first trigger the selection list is limited to similar types of notifications based on filters and replacement text options used. 

### Subscription created notification

Subscriptions can be assigned manually by an administrator, when a student redeems a subscription training key, or through the API. The Subscription created trigger can be used to notify a student that they have a subscription assigned by an administrator, or to notify an administrator that a subscription has been created by redeeming a key or through the API.

You must go to the Subscription Profiles tab to designate which subscription profiles will trigger a notification.

### Add a trigger event
Select trigger(s) for your automated notification.
1. Beside Trigger Event click the **Add event** link, this opens a pick list of triggers.
1. Select a trigger and click **Add** to enable the trigger for your notification, it is added in the Trigger Event field.
1. Click **Add event** again to add more triggers.

## Select the user triggering the notification and users receiving the notification
The Triggered by and Send to selections are based on the user’s roles. Trigger by allows you to choose the person completing the action triggering the notification, while Send to indicates who the recipients of the notifications will be. For example, if you would like to have a notification sent when a staff member enrolls a student into a class, then you will choose Triggered by Administrator and Send to User.

### Triggered by
For most notifications, two user types are available to select from as the one triggering the action to send the notification, User or Administrator.  

For Triggered by: 
* User refers to a student taking an action in the platform.
* Administrator means a user with a role with administrative rights acting in the platform. 

One or both can be selected as the one triggering the notification. For example, both a student and an administrator can cancel a student’s enrollment, you may want to set up a notification where it is sent when either have initiated the cancellation.

No user is selected for time-based triggers, they are triggered based on the time selected in the trigger filters.

### Add a triggered by user
Select the user taking the action in the platform that triggers the notification.

1. Check the box beside **User** or **Administrator** based on the criteria above.

### Select users receiving the notification
Notification recipients are set by role. For some choices the user role chosen is limited based on their connection to the trigger event. In other cases, everyone in your organization with the chosen role will receive the notification. 
 
#### Send to options:
Explanations of the users available when setting up notifications are listed below.

**User**
When the user is the recipient, user is not defined by role but is a user that the trigger event and filters apply to. For example, for the Class Enrollment enrolled trigger, all users enrolled in the class receive a notification.

**Account Executive**
Adding the Account Executive as a recipient will send a notification to a user’s Account Executive when the trigger event and filters applies to that user. The Account Executive is set on the User profile.

**Class Custom Users**
Class custom users is a custom field option that can be added to a class allowing specific users to be selected based on their role.

Select the custom fields you want added and notifications are sent to the users added to a class through that field. 

**Organization Managers**
Adding Organization managers allows you to choose roles, like Operations Manager or Automated Notification Recipient 1, once added all users with that role are sent a notification.
