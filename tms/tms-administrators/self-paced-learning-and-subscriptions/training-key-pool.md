# How can I use training key pools for self-paced learning?

> [!Alert] Please be aware that not all functionality covered in this article may be available to you.

Training key pools allow you to distribute keys to users for them to create self-paced course assignments. The pool gives access to one course, with multiple keys to distribute to different users. The user can take and re-take the training for as long as the course assignment is valid. This method is much more efficient than creating individual course assignments for each student if multiple course assignments are needed. With training key pools you can set the duration of access to content for students, designating that students have access to the course's labs for a limited amount of time.

Each key is unique and assigned to an individual user. Keys can only be used once by one user. A list of keys can be exported as a CSV file to accomodate distribution to your students. The training key pool keeps track redeemed keys displaying who redeemed a key and when it was redeemed. There’s no limit to the number of keys created, if the number of keys initially generated is insufficient, new keys can be created later and added to the same pool. You are not billed when keys are created, but will be invoiced when a key is redeemed creating a course assignment.

To create a training key pool:

1. On the **Admin** menu in the **Training Keys** group, click **Create Training Key Pool**.
1. Enter the **Name** of the training key pool.
1. Click **Choose** next to **Course**.
1. In the **Choose Course** dialog, search for and select the course to align the pool with and click **OK**.
1. Set the **Starts** date - when the keys can start to be redeemed.
1. Set the **Expires** date – when the keys can no longer be redeemed. This may be helpful if you know that a new version of the course will soon be available and would like to ensure that the keys for an older version are no longer used.
1. Set the **Content Availability**, this limits the duration students have access to the course. This can be set up to 180 days.
1. Click the **Training Keys** tab. Here you may either create your own keys or generate keys. Each key is required to be unique.
1. Enter the first key and click **Add Training Key** for each additional key  – OR – 
1. Click **Add Multiple Training Keys** and in the **Add Multiple Training Keys** dialog, paste your training keys with one per line and click **OK** – OR – 
1. Click **Generate Training Keys** and in the pop-up dialog enter the number of keys to create and click **OK**.
