# How can an administrator print completion certificates for self-pace learning?

When completion certificate templates are added to a course, the certificate is available to be printed for any course assignment using that course. Administrators have the option of printing from a PDF of the certificate or a Word file that permits editing of the content. All data pulled into the certificates is from the TMS. For instance, if a user name is showing incorrectly, it may be changed in the User Profile or edited directly on the certificate.

For self-paced learning, administrators can print a completion certificate for a course assignment once the student has completed the course assignment or it has been marked complete by an administrative user. Completion certificates for self-paced learning are available to print from the student's transcript:
1. On the **User Profile**, click **Transcript**. 
1. Under the **Course Assignment** section, find the course name and click the **certificate** icon. 
1. If more than one completion certificate is available for a course, a dialog opens listing all available certificate types. 
     1. Select a certificate template 
     1. Click **OK** to download the files. 
1. Open the downloaded zip file containing PDFs and Word documents of each certificate. 
1. Open the student certificates and print.
