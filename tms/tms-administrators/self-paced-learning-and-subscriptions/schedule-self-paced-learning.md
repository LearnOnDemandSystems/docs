# How do I schedule self-paced learning for a student?

Self-paced learning is done through a course assignment. It gives the student direct access to labs without a class enrollment. When you create a course assignment, the student's access begins immediately and defaults to expire in 6 months. The expiration can be changed; however, extending the date past 6 months will incur a second charge for the full amount of the lab. Charges for course assignments are determined the same as a class. To see how much a course assignment will cost, review [How do I see available courses and determine how much I will be charged for a lab in one of them?](../courses-and-activities/see-available-courses-and-determine-cost-for-lab-in-one.md).

Students can access the course assignment from the **Current Training** page. Under **Course Assignments**, the student will click the name of the course to open the assignment and access their labs. After a course assignment has been completed, the assignment moves to the student's **Transcript** page. A completed course assignment is accessed by clicking the **Transcript** link and clicking the course name. Students have the ability to launch a new instance of completed labs as long as the expiration date has not passed.
