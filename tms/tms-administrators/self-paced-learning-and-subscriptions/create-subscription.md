# How can I create a subscription?

> Please be aware that functionality covered in this and linked articles may not be available to you.

A subscription is a set of courses available to a subscriber to take and retake an unlimited number of times within a limited time period. While a user’s subscription is active, they can select any course in the subscription catalog, auto-create a course assignment and immediately begin their training. Using subscriptions enables your users to work through the training they want, when they want it, without your staff having to manage individual course assignments.

To begin, you must create a Subscription Profile. A Subscription Profile is a template that determines many things, including the organization availability, courses and the duration of assignment availability. All the parameters set in the Subscription Profile are applied to each Subscription Assignment created from it.

1.	From Site Administration’s Subscriptions tile, select **Subscription Profiles**.
