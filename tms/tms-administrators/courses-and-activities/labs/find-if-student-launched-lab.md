# How do I find if or when a student has launched a lab?

> [!Alert] Please be aware that not all functionality covered in this article may be available to you.

When you need to know if or when students have launched a lab, you can use the Find Lab Instances search page. You can find any instance of a lab which was launched and search by items like a student's name, an instructor's name, a class name, a lab name and/or a time period.

To do this: 
 1. On the **Admin** menu in the **Labs** group, click **Find Lab Instances**. This will bring up the Find Lab Instances search page with several filters to help you locate the labs you are looking for. 
 1. If needed, click the **Add filter** dropdown.
 1. Select the appropriate filter(s). 
 1. Fill-in the information you are looking for
 1. Click **Search**.

The search results will list the labs along with the Lab Series, the User, the Start and End dates, and the Completion Status. If the lab you are looking for is not listed in the search results, it has not been launched. If the lab instance is listed, you can click **Details** to the right of it to open the **Lab Instance** page. This page provides much more detailed information about that lab instance such as when the lab was started, the last activity, etc.
