# How do I add labs to my course?

> [!Alert] Please be aware that not all functionality covered in this and linked articles may be available to you. 

Course activities provide access to hands-on labs and other learning components in classes, course assignments, and learning paths. A lab activity provides access to a lab built on the Learn on Demand Systems' Lab on Demand platform. When the student clicks the Launch button on the activity, the lab interface opens in another window. 

The steps below assume you have completed the Basic Information section in the course ([How do I create a basic course?](./overall/create-course.md)). Before adding a course activity, you should select whether the course will available instructor-led and/or available self-paced on the Basic Information tab. This will affect the defaults for visibility of the activities you add for classes and course assignments.

To add a lab to your course:
1. On the **Create Course** or **Edit Course** page, click **Activities**.
1. Click **Add Lab**.
1. In the **Choose Lab** dialog, search for and select the lab(s) you want to add to the course and click **OK**. See [What does it mean when I get a 'Max RAM settings' warning when adding a lab to a course?](max-ram.md) for additional information.

Each lab activity has the following fields you can set for more control over that activity.
- **Availability** dropdown - limits who can view and launch the lab activity. It defaults to Everyone but you can limit it to Instructors only if the activity is not intended for student consumption.
- **Required for course completion** - requires a student to complete the lab for the course assignment or class enrollment to be marked **Complete**.
- **Available Instructor-Led** - makes the activity visible in classes and class enrollments.
- **Available Self-Paced** - makes the activity visible in course assignments.
- **Allow Retakes** - controls whether the student is able to launch the lab again after completing it.
