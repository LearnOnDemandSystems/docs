# How can I find how long a lab will be saved for?

The length of time a lab is saved is determined by several factors, among them: a user's roles, the type of learning (Instructor-led vs. Self-paced) and class sessions scheduled.

Standard lab saves are as follows:

- Users with the **Operations Manager** role can save 2 labs for 7 days.
- Users with an **Instructor** role can save 5 labs for 7 days.
- Students can save up to 2 labs:
     - Self-paced learning through a course assignment provides 7-day lab saves 
     - Instructor-led training scheduled on consecutive class days has 2-day lab saves 
     - Instructor-led training scheduled on non-consecutive class days has 7-day lab saves 

## Class Sessions

The way that class sessions are scheduled directly affects lab save times. When setting up sessions for a class, we recommend using the **Add Multiple Session Times** link when a class meets for more than one day. The TMS uses sessions to determine lab save times for students.

If a class has sessions on consecutive days, student labs are saved for 2 days. If a class has sessions on nonconsecutive days, student labs are saved for 7 days. These are the standard labs saves applied across the TMS, however, there are exceptions. For example, this does not apply to all courses; courses using Public IP Addresses require a lab save every 3 days.

We can set up lab saves outside of these defaults for special circumstances when necessary. If you need labs in a class to be saved for a different time period, please submit a Support ticket at [**https://lod.one/help**](https://lod.one/help). 

## View Lab Save Time
If you want to see if labs in a particular class can be saved and if so, for how long:
1. Impersonate a user in the appropriate role. 
1. Navigate to the student **Class Enrollment** or the **Class** page (depending on the role). 
1. Expand the **Activities** area and click **Launch** for any lab. 
1. Once the lab has started, locate the **Exit** menu. 
     1. If the lab is unable to be saved, you will see **End Lab**. 
     1. If the lab is able to be saved, you will see **Save and Close Lab**. 
1. Click **Save and Close Lab**.
     - A Confirm Save dialog box will appear. In it will be the amount of time the lab will be saved and its expiration date and time.
