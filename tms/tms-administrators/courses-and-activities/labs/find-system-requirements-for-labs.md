# Where do I find the system requirements for labs?

Every lab has certain network system requirements. Some of these requirements may vary depending on the type of lab you are launching.  You can view the requirements without accessing a class: [System Requirements Documentation](/tms/connectivity-requires.md)

Along with the requirements, this documentation contains links for proxy requirement, a connection assessment test and an article for interpreting your results, and other documentation. There can be additional requirements for special labs. If you have questions, please submit a Support ticket at [**https://lod.one/help**](https://lod.one/help) for more information.

In addition, on the **Class Enrollment** page, there may be a button to check if required software is installed on the user's machine. This can be found in the **Software Check** section of the Enrollment page for any class that has labs.
