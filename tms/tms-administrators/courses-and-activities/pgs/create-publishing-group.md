# How do I create a Publishing Group?

Publishing groups are the way to grant access to other organizations to consume your content for their training. Creating a publishing group and making it available to others is a multi-step process that will include coordination with LODS. This article will cover how to build a basic publishing group with no content or published organizations; adding courses and published organizations will be covered in other articles.

To create a publishing group:
1. Click **Publishing Groups** in the **Courses** group on the **Admin** menu. This opens the Find Publishing Groups page. 
1. Click **Create Publishing Group** in the upper right corner.
1. On the **Basic Information** tab,
    1. Type the **Name** of the publishing group.
    1. Type a **Description**. This is visible to administrators only.
    1. Set the **Organization** that will own the publishing Group. This will default to the organization in your profile.
1. On the **Availability** tab, click **Add Organizations**, select your sub-organizations that will be able to put their courses in this publishing group, and click **OK**.
1. Click **Save** to save the publishing group.

The next Best Practice steps for creating a publishing group are: 
1. Add courses (see [How do I add a course to my publishing group?](add-courses-to-publishing-group.md))
1. Add organizations you manage as Published Organizations (see [How do I designate an organization as a Published Organization for my publishing group?](add-published-orgs-to-publishing-group.md)). For those organizations you do not manage, an authorization form needs to be completed with LODS for the organization, and the LODS Operations team will add them as a Published Organization.
