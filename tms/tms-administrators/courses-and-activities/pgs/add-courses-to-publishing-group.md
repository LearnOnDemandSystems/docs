# How do I add a course to my publishing group?

> [!Alert] Please be aware that not all functionality covered in this and linked articles may be available to you. 

For other organizations to consume your courses through their classes and course assignments, your courses must belong to a publishing group for which the organizations are designated as published organizations. 

Now that you have created your publishing group for a specific audience, it is time to add the courses that should belong to it.

To add a course to a publishing group:
1. Navigate to the course and click **Edit**.
1. On the **Availability** tab, under **This course is available to the following publishing groups**, click **Add Publishing Groups**.
1. In the **Choose Publishing Groups** dialog, search for and select the publishing groups and click **OK**.
1. Click **Save** to save the change.

> [!ALERT] Organizations are only allowed to have access to a course through one publishing group. Therefore, if this is not the first publishing group on the course and this publishing group already has published organizations, you may receive an error message: **[The publishing group] cannot be added because one or more organizations already have access through an existing Publishing Group.** If this occurs, please read [How do I find what organizations have access to a course through other publishing groups](pg-add-pg-error-resolution.md)

The next Best Practice step for creating a publishing group is: 
1. After an authorization form has been completed with LODS for an organization, add them as a Published Organization (see [How do I designate an organization as a Published Organization for my publishing group?](add-published-orgs-to-publishing-group.md)).
