# How can I preview a SCORM module belonging to my organization?

Have you just created a SCORM module in the TMS and want to ensure it launches? Are there SCORM modules whose content you are unfamiliar with? As an administrator with the correct permissions, you can start any SCORM modules belonging to the organizations you manage. To start a module:

1. From the **Site Administration** page, click **Find SCORM Modules** in the **SCORM/AICC** tile.
1. Add any necessary filters and criteria to narrow the results and click **Search**.
1. In the results, click either the name or **Details** on the right side of the row of a module belonging to an organization you manage.
1. This will open the SCORM Module profile page. On this page, click **Start**.

This will show up as a SCORM attempt in the results of the Find SCORM Attempts search page (see [How do I view SCORM attempts by my students?](view-scorm-attempts.md) article).
