Course activities provide access to documents, external links, and other learning components in classes, course assignments, and learning paths. These activities provide direct access to document or web pages on the web. When the student clicks the Launch button on the activity, the document or web page will open. You control if it opens in new window or within a frame in the same window.

Before adding a course activity, you should select whether the course will available instructor-led and/or available self-paced on the Basic Information tab. This will affect the defaults for visibility of the activities you add for classes and course assignments.

    1. (Optional) Enter the description of the document or external link to be displayed below the name of the activity in the course.
