# How do I view all SCORM attempts by my students?

When you need to know if or when students have attempted a SCORM module, you can use the Find SCORM Attempts search page. This page allows you to see all SCORM attempts made by your students. You can narrow the search to specific attempts based on a student's name, the SCORM module's name, the status, a time period. etc.

To view SCORM attempts:
1. On the **Admin** menu in the **SCORM/AICC** group, click **Find SCORM Attempts**. This will bring up the Find SCORM Attempts search page with several filters to help you locate the attempts you are looking for.
1. Click **Output Options** to add columns to the search results.
1. If needed, click the **Add filter** dropdown.
1. Select the appropriate filter(s).
1. Fill-in the information you want to see.
1. Click **Search**.

You will be able to see any SCORM attempts made by students you manage. You can click **Details** to the right of the SCORM attempt to open the **SCORM Attempt** page. This page provides detailed information about the attempt and the SCORM data, if any.
