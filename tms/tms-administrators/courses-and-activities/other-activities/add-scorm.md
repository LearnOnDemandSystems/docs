# How do I add SCORM modules to my course?

> Please be aware that not all functionality covered in this and linked articles may be available to you. 

Course activities provide access to SCORM modules and other learning components in classes, course assignments, and learning paths. A SCORM module activity provides direct access to SCORM content that has been uploaded to a SCORM module (see [Related Articles](#related-articles) for information on uploading SCORM content). When the student clicks the Launch button on the activity, the SCORM content will open and begin to play. 

The steps below assume you have completed the Basic Information section in the course ([How do I create a basic course?](../overall/create-course.md)). Before adding a course activity, you should select whether the course will available instructor-led and/or available self-paced on the Basic Information tab. This will affect the defaults for visibility of the activities you add for classes and course assignments.

To add a SCORM module to your course:
1. On the **Create Course** or **Edit Course** page, click **Activities**.
1. Click **Add SCORM Module**.
1. In the **Choose SCORM Module** dialog, search for and select the SCORM module(s) you want to add to the course and click **OK**.

Each SCORM activity has the following fields you can set for more control over that activity:
- **Duration** - sets the estimated amount of time the SCORM module should take. This may affect the overall duration of the class.
- **Availability** - limits who can view and launch the SCORM module activity. It defaults to Everyone but you can limit it to Instructors only if the activity is intended only for instructors.
- **Required for course completion** - requires a student to complete the SCORM module for the course assignment or class enrollment to be marked **Complete**.
- **Available Instructor-Led** - makes the activity visible in classes and class enrollments.
- **Available Self-Paced** - makes the activity visible in course assignments.
