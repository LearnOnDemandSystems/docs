An assessment is a multiple-choice exam or test to determine a user's comprehension of material. Assessments are added as course activities and can be mixed in among other activities. If you are interested in creating your own assessments for your courses, please submit a Support ticket at [**https://lod.one/help**](https://lod.one/help).

The steps below assume you have completed the Basic Information section in the course ([How do I create a basic course?](../overall/create-course.md)). Before adding a course activity, you should select whether the course will available instructor-led and/or available self-paced on the Basic Information tab. This will affect the defaults for visibility of the activities you add for classes and course assignments.

To add one of your assessments to your course:
1. On the **Create Course** or **Edit Course** page, click **Activities**.
1. Click **Add Assessment**.
1. In the **Choose Assessment** dialog, search for and select the assessment(s) you want to add to the course and click **OK**.

Each assessment activity has the following fields you can set for more control over it:
- **Duration** - sets the estimated amount of time the assessment should take. This may affect the overall duration of the class.
- **Availability** - limits who can view and launch the video activity. It defaults to Everyone but you can limit it to Instructors only if the activity is intended only for instructors.
- **Required for course completion** - requires a student to launch the video for the course assignment or class enrollment to be marked **Complete**.
- **Available Instructor-Led** - makes the activity visible in classes and class enrollments.
- **Available Self-Paced** - makes the activity visible in course assignments.
- **Allow Retakes** - controls whether the student is able to launch the assessment again after completing it.
- **Allow Review** - sets whether a student can review the results.
