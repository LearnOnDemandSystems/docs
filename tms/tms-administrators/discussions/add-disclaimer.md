# How can I add a disclaimer to all my discussions?

You can easily add a consistent message or policy to every discussion for your organization at once. This is done through your organization’s profile, and the Discussion Disclaimer tab. 

To add a disclaimer:

1. Edit the organization
1. Click the **Preferences** tab and scroll down to **Discussion Disclaimer**.
1. This is an HTML field. Add the message you want to appear at the top of a discussion to discussion participants.
1. Save the organization.

When a user accesses any of your organization’s discussions, the disclaimer will be displayed above the area to create a post when they access the discussion.
