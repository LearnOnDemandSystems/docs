# How do I create a discussion and attach it to a course?

A well-thought out discussion can encourage and increase student interaction and learning. Any user with the **Operations Manager** role can create and manage discussions for your organization or assign supplemental roles for creating or moderating discussions. 

To create a **Discussion**:
1. On the **Admin** menu, click **Create Discussion** in the **Discussions** group.
1. On the **Basic Information** tab,
    1. Type a **Name** that is brief but descriptive for the purpose of the discussion. This is visible to the end user,
    1. Type a **Description**. This is visible to administrators only.
    1. Set the **Organization** that will own the discussion. This will default to the organization in your profile.
1. On the **Topics** tab, click **Add**. Topics provide the structure for the discussion. Participant posts are made to/displayed by topic.
1. Type the title of the topic. 
1. Click **Add** again and repeat to add all the topics for the discussion. Topics can be rearranged by drag-and-drop.
1. Click **Save**.

Once a Discussion has been created, it must be attached to a course before it can be visible to an end user. 

To attach to a course:

1. Edit the course
1. Scroll to the bottom of the **Basic Information** tab.
1. Click **Choose** next to **Discussion**.
1. In the **Choose Discussion**, search for and select the discussion.
1. Save the course.
Once a Discussion is attached to a course, a link becomes visible to end users with participant permissions on the Course profile page as well as all Class, Class Enrollment, and Course Assignment profile pages using the course. 

> [!NOTE] If the course is available to multiple organizations, users in those organizations will be able to access and post to the discussion board from the same pages as users in the owning organization.
