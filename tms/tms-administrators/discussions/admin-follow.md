# How can I be notified of activity on a discussion?

To be notified of activity on a discussion, you can follow Topics and/or Posts on them. You decide if you are notified by email or as an announcement in the Message Center. Both will provide links back to the Topic and Post which has had the activity.

To follow a Topic or Post:

1. Click the **star** next to the Topic or Post you want to follow. This will open a dialog.
1. In the **How would you like to be notified?** dialog, select **E-mail** or **Message Center** and click **OK**.

When a participant, including you, posts on a topic you are following, you will be notified. Same is true when responses are added to a post you are following. You will not be notified when the following occurs:

- Someone comments on a response to a post, regardless if you are following the post or topic it is under.
- Someone likes a post, response, or comment.
- Someone responds to a post in a topic you are following. Only posts trigger emails or announcements for followed topics.
- A topic or post you are following is deleted by a moderator or administrator.

The announcements and emails will include the name of the topic or post which has had activity and a **more** or a **here** link. These will open the discussion in a new tab at the item you are following.

> [!NOTE] When you click **more** in an announcement, the **Message Center** stays open on the original tab and the item is marked as **Read**. You must click **OK** to save the **Read** status of the announcement. If the **Message Center** is opened from another tab before this, the announcement will not show as **Read**.
