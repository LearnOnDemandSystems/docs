# How can I control posts on discussions?

> [!Alert] Please be aware that not all functionality covered in this and linked articles may be available to you.

Discussions are a wonderful tool for opening dialogs with and between students. However, to be truly effective, at times posts, responses, and/or comments may need to be removed for the good of the overall discussion. Users with the Moderator role, when added to a discussion, have the ability to delete posts, responses, and comments from that discussion. All discussions should have at least one Moderator. Users with the Operations Manager role can assign the Moderator role.

To add one or more moderators to a discussion:

1. Edit the **Discussion** profile.
1. On the **Moderators** tab, click **Add.** 
1. The Choose Moderators dialog will open. This dialog is pre-filtered for users from the Discussion’s organization who have the specific moderator permissions. Use the filters to narrow the results and click **Search**.
1. Select the moderator(s) and click **OK**.
1. Click **Save**.

A moderator can access discussions from the Course profile page(s) where the discussion is associated or from Find Discussions. 

To access from a **Course** profile:
1. Click **Discussion** in the command area. This will take you to the topics and their posts.

To access from **Find Discussions**:
1. Click the name of the discussion in the search results.
1. Click **Posts** in the upper right corner to be taken to the topics and their posts.

Once in a discussion, to delete a post, response, or comment on the board, click the X to the right of the item.

Moderators that have not been assigned to a discussion may be able to access the discussion but will not be able to delete posts, responses, and comments.
