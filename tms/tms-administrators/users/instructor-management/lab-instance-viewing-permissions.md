# How can I allow instructors to see lab instances and exam labs scores 

> Please be aware that functionality covered in this article may not be available to you.
 
Many organizations would like their instructors to be able to view lab instances or students’ results on exam labs. The instructor role does not give access to any lab instances; however, you can give access through a supplemental role and organization management. The role to be added is Supplemental – Lab Instance Viewing.

To add the role and organization management,
1.	From Site Administration on the Users tile, select **Find Users**.
1.	Search for and select the name of the user you want to update to open their User profile.
1.	On their user account, click **Edit**.
1.	Open the **Roles** tab, click the **Assign Roles** link, this opens the Role chooser dialog.
1.	Input all or part of the role’s name, **Supplemental – Lab Instance Viewing**, then click **Search**.
1.	**Select the role** from the search results and click **OK**.

1.	**Save**.

 
> :small_blue_diamond:  When choosing organization management only give access to the level you want that instructor to have visibility to lab instances. If you have multiple organizations in your hierarchy with parent and child organizations, giving access to an organization at a parent level also gives access to all the child or subordinate organizations under it; those organizations will be checked and read only if the parent is selected.
