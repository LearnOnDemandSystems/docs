# How do I create instructor user accounts?

User accounts specific for instructors can be added in the TMS. These accounts will automatically assign the Instructor permissions your trainers will need to login, manage classes and labs, and host virtual classes. Each user account created must use a unique email address.

To create an instructor account:
1. On the **Admin** menu in the **Instructor** group, click **Create Instructor**. 
1. This opens up the Create User page. Fill in the following required fields: 
     1. **First Name** 
     1. **Last Name**
     1. **Primary Email**
     1. **Username**
     1. **Password**. 
1. Verify that the instructor is being added to the correct **Organization** and **Time Zone**. 
1. Click **Save**.

You may fill-in data in the other fields if you wish to capture it here. These fields and the other tabs will be covered in future articles.
