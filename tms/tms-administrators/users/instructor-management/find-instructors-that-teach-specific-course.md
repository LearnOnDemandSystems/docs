# How can I find instructors that can teach a specific course?

You can use filters on the Find Instructors page and the Choose Instructor dialog box from the Create/Edit Class page to narrow the list of instructors to ones whose profiles match your criteria. On the Find Instructors page this could be those who have attended, prepared for, or are certified to teach a course you choose. Only the certified filter is available in the Choose Instructor dialog box and only after a course is chosen. 

To find instructors for a course:
1. Click **Find Instructors** on the **Admin** menu. 
1. On the **Find Instructors** page, click **Add Filter** dropdown and select one these filters:
     1. **Certified for course (choose)**
     1. **Prepared for course (choose)**
     1. **Attended course (choose)**
1. After you have added the filter(s), in the **Choose Course** dialog box, use the filters to search for the course you want. 
1. Click the appropriate course and click **OK**. 
1. Click **Search**.

The instructors whose profiles match your criteria will be displayed.
