# How can students print completion certificates?

Students can access and print a completion certificate from a PDF for completed training in the TMS. In order for students to print certificates, 
- the course must have a certificate template, 
- the student must have a supplemental role giving them rights to print certificates, 
- the training must be at a completed status in the TMS.

Students cannot print certificates without a supplemental role added allowing them this ability. Organizations who want to give students the ability to print certificates may add the role, Student - Certificate Printing; this can be added by anyone with the Operations Manager role. It may also be added as a default role for all users created in your organization. Please submit a Support ticket at [**https://lod.one/help**](https://lod.one/help) for assistance setting this up.

A student's class enrollment or self-paced training must be at a status of Completed before they can print a certificate. For a class enrollment, an administrator or the instructor must mark the student's **Completion Status** to **Complete** on the roster or student enrollment. For self-paced learning, the course assignment's required activities must all be completed. The TMS will then automatically register the assignment as completed. An administrative user may also mark an assignment as **Complete** regardless of the activities' statuses. To do this, open the course assignment and select the **Mark Complete** link.

Once the enrollment or assignment is showing as complete, it will show on the student's transcript. Training which has a completion certificate available will show a certificate icon. To print a certificate:

1. Click the **Completion certificate** icon.
1. If more than one completion certificate is available for a course, a dialog opens listing all available certificate types. 
     1. Select a certificate template
     1. Click **OK** to download the files. 
1. Open the downloaded zip file containing a PDF of the certificate. 
1. Open the certificate and print.
