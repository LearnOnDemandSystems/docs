# How do I create student user accounts?

User accounts for students provide all the needed rights to login, attend classes, open labs and virtual classes with the Basic User role. This is the default user role in the TMS, so each user you create is automatically given Basic User privileges. The system requires using a unique email address on every user account.

To create a user account:
1. On the **Admin** menu in the **Users** group, click **Create User**. 
1. This opens up the Create User page. Some fields will be filled automatically based either on your own user account or the Organization Preferences. Fill in the following required fields: 
     1. **First Name**
     1. **Last Name**
     1. **Primary Email**
     1. **Username** - the default for this is set in Organization Preferences in the Organization profile.
     1. **Password** - the default for this is set in Organization Preferences in the Organization profile.
1. Verify that the student is being added to the correct **Organization** and **Time Zone**. These default to match those of the person creating the account.
1. Click **Save**.

You may fill-in data in other fields if you wish to capture it here. These fields and the other tabs will be covered in future articles.
