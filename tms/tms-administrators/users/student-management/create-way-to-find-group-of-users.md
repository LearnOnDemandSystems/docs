# How can I create a way to find a group of users?

> [!Alert] Please be aware that not all functionality covered in this article may be available to you.

If you are looking for a way to search for a group of users, then User Groups is the tool to use. You can name a group and apply it to a set of users. You can then use the group as a filter on Find pages and Choose dialogs for users. This can be a helpful tool to categorize your instructors or students.

The first step is to create your **User Group**. Then you will add your users to the group. Once these are set up and you are on a page or in a dialog that searches for users, you can use the **User Groups** filter to find them.

## Create A User Group

To create a **User Group**:
1. On the **Admin** menu in the **User Group** group, click **Create User Group**. 
1. Input a **Name**.
1. If applicable, click **Choose** next to **Company**, select the company, and click **OK**.
1. Click **Save**.

## Add Users to a User Group

After the User Group has been created, the users need to be added to the group. You can add users to the group in two ways: 1) via the User Group, or 2) from a User Profile.

### **Via the User Group**
This method is recommended for when you have multiple users to add to the same group at one time.

To add users via a User Group, 
1. Navigate to the **User Group** profile. 
1. On the **User Group** profile, click **Add Users**. 
1. This opens the **Users** page that lists current users. On this page, click **Add Users**.
1. This opens the Choose User dialog. Input part of the user's **First** and **Last Name**.
1. Click **Search**.
1. Select the user in the results and then search for another user. 
1. Continue searching and selecting until all your users are chosen.
1. Click **OK** to add them all to the group. 
1. Click **Save** to update the group.

### **From a User Profile**
This method is recommended for when you only have one user to add to a group or you want to add a user to multiple groups.


To add a **User Group** from a **User Profile**,
1. Navigate to the user's profile. 
1. Click **Edit**.
1. On the **Groups** tab, click **Add Groups** link. 
1. This opens the **Choose User Group** dialog. Input the group name and click **Search**. 
1. Select the User Group(s) from the search results and click **OK**.
1. Click **Save** to save the changes on the User Profile.

## Search by User Group

Once the User Group is created and the users have been added, you can use the User Group filter to help find them in searches. This filter is available from the **Add filter** menu from any page or dialog that searches for users, such as **Find** or **Choose Users**, **Find** or **Choose Instructors**, or **Find Enrollments**. 

The User Group filter works a little differently than an ordinary text field. 
1. Once the filter is added, begin to type in part of the group name. 
1. As you type a dropdown list will appear below the text field with the names of user groups matching what you have typed. Select the desired group from the list. 
1. Click **Search**.
