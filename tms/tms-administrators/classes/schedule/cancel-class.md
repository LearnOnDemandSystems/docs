# How can I cancel a class?

From time to time you will need to cancel a class. When this occurs, you should cancel the students enrolled in the class or move them to another class. You are not billed for students in cancelled classes.

To cancel the class after all the enrollments have been cancelled or moved:
1. On the **Admin** menu in the **Classes** group, click **Find Classes** link. This opens up the Find Classes page. 
1. Enter the Search Filters criteria for the class and click **Search**.
1. In the results, click the class **Name** for the class you want. This will open the Class page. 
1. On it, click **Edit**.
1. On the **Status** dropdown, click **Cancelled** and click **Save**.
