# How do I create a class?

Classes are used to schedule meeting times and give students access to course activities for instructor-led training. If course activities are not needed for the meeting, then a Custom Event can be used.

To create a class: 
1. On the **Admin** menu in the **Classes** group, click **Create Class**. This opens up the Create Class page. 

On the **Basic Information** section: 
1. To add a Course, click **Choose** next to **Course**. 
1. In the **Choose Course** dialog, input part of the course **Name** and click **Search**. 
1. Select the course from the search results and click **OK**. This brings you back to the Create Class page with the course added. 
1. Change the **Display Name**, if needed. 
1. If you are creating a class for an organization other than the one you belong to, click **Show Advanced Settings** on the upper right side and verify the **Organization** is correct. 
1. Change the **Minimum Students** to the number of students the organization needs to run the class.
1. Set the **Maximum Students** field to the total number of students that can be enrolled. 
1. Select the appropriate status from the **Status** dropdown.
1. Modify other fields as needed.

Expand the **Session Times** section. 
1. Click **Add Multiple Session Times**. 
1. The **# Sessions** field will default to match the number of training days set up on the course you selected for this class. Verify this is the correct number of days. 
1. For **Days**, select the pattern of days your class will run, e.g. **Mon**, **Wed**, **Fri** or **Mon**, **Tues**, **Wed**, **Thurs**, **Fri**. Sessions will be added or skipped based on the pattern you select. 
1. Use the **First Day** field to choose the first day of class. 
1. Modify the **Start Time** and **End Time** as needed. 
1. Click **OK**.

Expand the **Delivery** section. 
1. If this class will be delivered in person only, ensure **Delivery Type** is set to **Physical**.
   1. Select the **Add Classroom** link and click **Search**. 
   1. Select the classroom(s) and then click **OK**.
1. If this class will be delivered online only, change **Delivery Type** to **Virtual**.
1. If this class will be delivered both in person and online, change **Delivery Type** to **Physical and Virtual** and add your classroom as above.

Expand the **Instructors** section.
1. Click **Add Instructor**. 
1. Input part of the **Last Name** and **First Name** of the instructor and click **Search**. Select the instructor from the search results. If you have more than one instructor, search for and select the other instructors. 
1. Once all the instructors for the class are selected, click **OK**.

Finally, click **Save** to create the class. 

>[!NOTE] The other sections (Visibility, Payment, and HTML Description) can be changed later. 

Once the class is created the TMS creates a template by retaining all of your selections except for the class dates, this is to help you create additional classes more quickly.
