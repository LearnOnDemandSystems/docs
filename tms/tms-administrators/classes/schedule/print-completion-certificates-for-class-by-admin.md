# How can an administrator print completion certificates for a class?

Once completion certificate templates are added to a course, the certificate is available to be printed for any class using that course. Administrators have the option of printing from a PDF of the certificate or a Word file that permits editing of the content. All data pulled into the certificates is from the TMS. For instance, if a user name is showing incorrectly, it may be changed in the User Profile or edited directly on the certificate.
