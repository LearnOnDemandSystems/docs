# How can an administrator print completion certificates for a class?

> [!Alert] Please be aware that not all functionality covered in this article may be available to you.

Once completion certificate templates are added to a course, the certificate is available to be printed for any class using that course. Administrators have the option of printing from a PDF of the certificate or a Word file that permits editing of the content. All data pulled into the certificates is from the TMS. For instance, if a user name is showing incorrectly, it may be changed in the User Profile or edited directly on the certificate.

For instructor-led training, administrative users can print certificates from the class profile or roster at any time:

     1. Select a certificate template.
     1. Click **OK** to download the files. 
1. Open the downloaded zip file containing PDFs and Word documents of each certificate.
