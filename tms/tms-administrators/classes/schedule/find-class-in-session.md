# How do I find a class that is in session?

> :small_blue_diamond: Please be aware that functionality covered in this and linked articles may not be available to you.

You can view all classes in the TMS for your organization(s). By default, the Find Classes search is set to find all future classes for your organization(s). This means if the class is going to start in one minute or 5 weeks, the class will show in the search results. However, if the class has started already, it is considered to be in progress or started in the past. Because of this, you need to search for it differently.

To find a class that is in session: 
1. On the **Admin** menu, in the **Classes** group, click **Find Classes**. This opens up the Find Classes page. 
1. Choose an appropriate **Starts** filter to apply to your search. 
   1. For instance, the **Starts** filter can be set to **Today** or **Yesterday** or can be set to **Within the Last** along with a calendar to choose the date. 
1. Alternately, you can search for classes that are in session by adding the filter called **In Progress Now**; to use this you will need to remove the **Starts** filter. 
1. Add other filters you want and click **Search**. 
1. To view additional data columns in the search results, click **Output Options** and check the columns you want.
1. After selecting/deselecting **Output Options** columns, click **Search** to display the new results. 
1. In the results, click the class **Name** for the class you want. This will open the Class page to view details.
