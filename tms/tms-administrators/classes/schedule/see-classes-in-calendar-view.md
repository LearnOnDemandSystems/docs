# How can I see classes in a calendar view?

When classes are created, their sessions are scheduled and can be viewed in the organization's calendar. This way, an organization can see all classes for a month.

To view your classes in a calendar view:
1. From the **Site Administration** page, click **My Organizations** on the **Organizations** tile. 
1. Click **Calendar** for the organization whose classes you want to see. By choosing the parent organization's **Calendar**,  you may select to see all child organizations' classes on one calendar or you can select a child organization's **Calendar** to only view its classes.

On the **Calendar** page, you may use the Search Filters to narrow your view. Under **Output Options**, you may choose to display **Instructors**, **Classrooms**, or the **Program** as well as either individual sessions or entire events.

If you want to view the classes by week or day, click the **week** or **day** buttons on the right side. To move forward or backward in the calendar, click the left (<) and right (>) buttons on the left side. 

You also have the ability to right-click on a class in the calendar to view the class information or make changes to the class. The options available are as follows (they open in the same window unless noted):

- **Details** - opens the Class page
- **Details (new window)** - opens the Class page in a new window
- **Edit** - opens the Class page in Edit mode
- **Roster** - opens the Roster page for the class
- **Edit Times** - opens the Sessions section for the class in Edit mode
- **Change Primary Instructor** - opens the Instructor section for the class in Edit mode
- **Change Primary Room** - opens the Delivery section for the class in Edit mode
