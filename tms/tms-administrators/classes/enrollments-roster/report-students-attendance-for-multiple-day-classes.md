# How do I report on students' attendance for multiple day classes?

> [!Alert] Please be aware that not all functionality covered in this article may be available to you.

To view attendance data on multiple day classes, you must register the class' attendance using the Attendance Chart. When attendance is recorded there, the consolidated data for your organization can be pulled from the Find Class Attendance page.

You can go directly to the attendance chart on the Class profile for all students in one class or to Find Class Attendance to view the days any/all students were in any class.

To open the reporting:
1.	On the **Admin** menu, go to the **Class Enrollments** group and click **Find Class Attendance**. 
     - Each class session for each student is a separate row in the search results. 
     - A 5 day class has 5 separate rows for each student enrolled in the class. 
     - The Attended column shows whether the student attended or not.

The report's filters and output options can be adjusted to report the data you need and then you can export the data to Excel.
