# How do I record student attendance for a multiple day class?

> [!Alert] Please be aware that not all functionality covered in this article may be available to you.

While marking a student's completion status Attending on the roster shows the student's overall status of being in class, it does not tell you if the student attended each day of class. The Attendance Chart permits you to track your students' daily attendance on multiple day classes. An attendance report can then be pulled showing the days the student attended class.

The Attendance Chart link displays once class begins. Attendance may be marked manually by the instructor or organization's administrative users to show the days each student came to class. Setting a student's Completion Status to Attending registers their attendance on the attendance chart for 1-day classes only. If the class is multiple days, it does not register attendance for any of the days. Each day must be marked on the attendance chart when a class has multiple sessions.

>[!NOTE] The TMS will automatically register students who are attending virtually through one of our integrated virtual classroom meeting hosts on the attendance chart each day when they click the Launch Class button on their enrollment. Additionally, if your organization uses the Student Check-in, checking in a student on the Check-In page automatically marks students attending on the Roster and updates the Attendance Chart.

To open the **Attendance Chart**:
1.	On the **Admin** menu in the **Classes** group, click **Find Classes**.
2.	Search for and select your class.
3.	On the **Class** profile, click **Attendance Chart**.
4.	Check boxes to mark attendance.

Please note, the class start date and time is the trigger to display the attendance chart link.
