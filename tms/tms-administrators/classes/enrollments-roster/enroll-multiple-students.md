# How do I enroll multiple students?

There are a couple of tools in the TMS you can use to register students. The the class roster is the one that lets you create multiple registrations all at once. Several different registration statuses exist to help you track whether the student should be granted access to a class.

To create multiple enrollments:

1. On the **Admin** menu in the **Classes** group, click **Find Classes**. This opens the Find Classes page.
1. Input part of the name of the class you want in the **Name** field and click **Search**.
1.  Find the class in the search results, and on the class's row click the **Roster** link (the icon of 2 students) on the right. 
1. On the **Roster** page, click **Add Students**. This opens the Choose User dialog. 
1. Input part of the name of a student, click **Search**. 
1. Check the box next to the student to enroll. 
1. Repeat steps 5 and 6 to search for and select all of your students for class. 
1. Once all the students have been selected, click **OK**. 
1. All students will be added to the Roster with the status of Enrolled. Change the enrollment status to **Requested**. 
1. Click **Save** to add them to the class. 

> [!Knowledge] **Best practice** for adding students to class is to set the Enrollment Status to Requested. Then when the students show up for the class, mark them Enrolled. If they do not show up, mark them Cancelled. Note that LODS uses the Enrolled status to trigger billing for lab usage. Therefore, after a class begins the system will not permit the Enrollment Status of **Enrolled** to be changed. But you can change the **Requested** status to another status.

Students' enrollment statuses will need to be changed to Enrolled or Cancelled after the class starts.

> [!Alert] Remember that students must be in the status of Enrolled to be able to launch their labs when class starts.
