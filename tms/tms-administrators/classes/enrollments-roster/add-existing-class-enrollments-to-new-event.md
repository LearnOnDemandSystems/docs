# How can I add an existing class's enrollments to a new event?

Have you ever had to cancel a class and move the enrolled students to a different class date? Or have the same set of students that need to be enrolled in multiple classes? You can retrieve all enrollments from the class that has them to the new class so you don't have to create each individual enrollment over again.

To add the student enrollments:
1. Open the class where you want to add the student enrollments.
1. Click **Roster** on the Command bar. 
1. On the **Roster** page, click **Add Students from Event**. This opens a Choose Event dialog. 
1. Search for and select the class with the enrollments you want and click **OK**. 
1. Click **Save Changes** to add all enrolled students from the class you selected to the new class as **Enrolled**.

> [!Alert] Please note, this function will add all the students who were enrolled in the selected class to clone their enrollment to the new class regardless of their organization. It will NOT add students with any other enrollment status.
