# What information should I send to students when I create their enrollments?

When you have created user accounts and enrolled students into a class, you will need to send them the URL to login along with their login credentials. You can revise the following template to send your students login instructions as well as steps on how to access their labs and prepare for class.

***
    
Go to URL: **[Input the URL to your login page]**

Input your login information:
- Username: **[Input the username you created for the student]**
 - Password: **[Input the password you created for the student]**

This opens your Current Training page. Under the **Classes** section, click the class name to access your enrollment. 
    
Once class starts, **Launch** buttons will appear beside the course activities.

For technical assistance with labs, click the Contact button at the top of any page and use one of the methods provided to request assistance.
