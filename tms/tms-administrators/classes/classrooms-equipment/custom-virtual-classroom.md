## How can I use my organization’s virtual meeting program in my virtual classes?

If you have a virtual meeting program you would like to use for your virtual classes, all you will need is the URL for it. Your students will be able to access the meeting program from their class enrollment. 

To set your class up to use your own virtual classroom:
1. On the **Create/Edit Class** page, expand the **Delivery** section.
1. On the **Delivery Type** dropdown select either **Virtual** or **Physical and Virtual**.
1. The Virtual Meeting Host field will appear. In its dropdown select **Custom Virtual Classroom**.
1. The URL field will appear. Enter the unique **URL** for the virtual classroom. This can be a Skype for Business meeting URL, a Join.me URL or any other URL that your organization wants to use.<a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a>

When the students click Enter Classroom, they will be taken to the URL provided. The TMS passes along the classId, studentLastName, studentFirstName, and studentEmail to the receiving site.

> [!KNOWLEDGE] <sup>**1**</sup>**BEST PRACTICE**: The Enter Classroom button remains available to students on their class enrollment after the class is over. Therefore, it is best to use unique URLs for each class to avoid students from an old class accidentally getting into a new class.

To find your classes that use custom virtual classrooms, you can use the new Custom Virtual Classroom filter and output option on Find Classes.
