# How can I create a classroom that is outside my organization's physical location?

There may be times when you will be holding a class at a site external to your organization's physical location. You can create a classroom in the TMS for this site. When you use this classroom for a class in the TMS, your students and instructor can click the Classroom name link to see its address, and, if provided, a map. In addition, you can control enrollments based on its capacity.

To create a classroom outside your organization:
1. On the **Admin** menu in the **Classrooms** group, click **Create Classroom**. This opens up the Create Classroom page. 
1. On the **Basic Information** tab, type the **Name** of the classroom and set its **Capacity**. The Organization field is automatically filled in from your profile. 
1. Click the **External Location** tab and select the **Is an external location** checkbox. 
1. Complete the address fields for the external classroom. 
1. If you have directions or a URL to a map for the classroom location, add it in the **Directions/Map URL** field. 
1. Check **Show map in page** if you want a map to be generated on the **Classroom** page based on the address entered.
1. Click **Save**.
