# How do I create classrooms?

You can prevent double booking and overbooking of your physical classrooms when you add them to the TMS and assign them to your classes. When a classroom is assigned to a class, the TMS checks its availability and will warn you of conflicts. It also checks the capacity of the room when enrollments assigned to the classroom are added to the class.


To create a classroom:
1.  On the **Site Admin** page in the **Classrooms** tile, click **Create Classroom**. This opens up the Create Classroom page. 
1. On the **Basic Information** tab, type the **Name** of the classroom and set its **Capacity**. The Organization field is automatically filled in from your profile. 
1. Click **Save** to create the classroom.
