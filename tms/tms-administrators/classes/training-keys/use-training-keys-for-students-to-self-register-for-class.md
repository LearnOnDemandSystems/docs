# How can I use training keys for students to self-register for a class?

Training keys can be generated for each class created and distributed to students to enroll into the class and, if needed, to create their own user account in the TMS. Some setup by the LODS team is needed to enable the ability for students to create user accounts. Please submit a Support ticket at [**https://lod.one/help**](https://lod.one/help) for information.

Training keys are unique to each class and each student will need a unique key to register. Training keys are created from the Class Profile page . To navigate to a class and create training keys:
1. On the **Admin** menu in the **Classes** group, click **Find Classes**. 
1. Input part of the class name and click **Search**
1. Click the class name in the search results. 
1. From the **Class Profile** in the menu bar underneath the class name, click **Training Keys**.
1. On the **Training Keys** page, click **Generate Training Keys**.
1. In the message dialog, type the number of keys you want to generate (one for each expected student) and click **OK**. The training keys will be listed. 

You will then need to provide a unique Training Key to each student to allow them to register for the class. An easy way to do this is to export the training keys to a .csv file and email a key to each student. To do this:
1. Click **Admin** to open the **Admin** menu.
1. In the **Class Enrollments** group, click **Find Enrollment Training Keys**.
1. From the **Add filter** dropdown, add the **Class** filter.
1. In the **Choose Class** dialog, input part of the class name and click **Search**.
1. Click the class in the search results and click **OK**.
1. On the **Find Enrollment Training Keys** page, on the right side, click **Output Options** and select the columns you would like to see in the search results.
1. Click **Search**.
1. Click **Export** above the search results. All columns visible and their data will be exported to a .csv file in the sort order of the results.
1. Email a key to each student.

## Class Training Keys
If Class Vouchers were used to create the class, the link on the **Class Profile** page to access the Class Training Keys page will be **Class Training Keys**. This page displays each **Voucher Code** and its associated **Training Key**. This data can be exported to a .csv file by clicking the **Export** link next to **Class Vouchers**
