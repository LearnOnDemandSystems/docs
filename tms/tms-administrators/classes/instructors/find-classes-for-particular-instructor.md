# How can I find the classes for a particular instructor?

> [!Alert] Please be aware that not all functionality covered in this article may be available to you.

You can filter the **Find Classes** page for classes that a particular instructor has been added. The instructor does not have to be assigned to any sessions or be the primary instructor for the class or a session. They just have to be in the class(es).

To do this:
1. On the **Admin** menu in the **Classes** group, click **Find Classes**.
1. On the **Find Classes** page, click the **Add filter** dropdown and click **Instructor**. The Choose Instructor dialog will open.
1. Add the criteria for the instructor you want and click **Search**.
1. Select the instructor from the results and click **OK**.
1. Click **Search**.

All classes that are scheduled using the instructor will show in the search results. The **Instructor** column in the results will show the instructor who is designated as Primary for the class.
