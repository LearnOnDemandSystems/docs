# How do I reuse search settings or create default settings on search pages?

Are you tired of having to add the same search filters and criteria every time you are on a search page? If so, you can save your search parameters for reuse any time. You can save one or more searches and you can choose a search to be the default search which automatically opens each time you return to that page. Using saved searches is also a convenient way to build reports you will run periodically.

To save search parameters: 

1. On the **Find X** page, click **Add Filters** and select any filters you want.
1. Delete any filters you don't need. 
1. Click **Ouput Options** to add columns in your search results and check or uncheck selections based on what you want to include. 
1. Click **Search** to view your results. 
1. If everything appears the way you want it, click **Save** located above the search filters. 
1. In the **Save Search** dialog, type the **Name** of the search
1. If wanted, check **Make this my default search**. This will cause this saved search with its criteria and output options to be applied each time you access this page.
1. Click **OK**. 

Saved searches are only available on the page they were created. 

To apply a saved search: 

1. Navigate to the **Find X** page. If you set your saved search to be the default, your search will run when the page is opened. 
1. To use a different saved search, click **Open** icon. 
1. Select the saved search and click **OK** to apply it. 
1. Click **Search** to see the results.
