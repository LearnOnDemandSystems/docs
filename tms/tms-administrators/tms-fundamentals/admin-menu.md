# What is the Admin menu and how does it work?

The Admin menu offers you the grouped administrative links from the Site Administration page in a menu format without leaving your current page. This menu offers you some important capabilities:
1. Search bar that allows you to search for a link without leaving the menu and click the link within the search results.
1. Group order so you can to choose to view the groups in their default order or in alphabetical order. 
1. History, which records your 8 most frequently clicked links.

## Search bar
When you open the **Admin** menu, your cursor will be in the Search bar. As you type, links that match what you have typed will appear. This list is narrowed as you continue to type. If you press **Enter**, you will be taken to the page corresponding to the first link in the results list. You can also click on any link in the results to navigate to that page.

## Group Order
There are two orders for the Admin groups on the menu: **Group** (default) and **A-Z**. The menu will open with the groups ordered in the default way. Click **A-Z** to vertically alphabetize the groups. The menu always opens with the default **Group** order.

## History
The History area provides you with quick access to those links you use the most. It does not appear until you have clicked a link from the menu. As you click links either from the search results or the menu, the 8 most frequently used links are listed under **History** on the left side of the menu. The **History** updates based on your usage. Here is an example scenario:
> Your History shows the following links (the number of times you have clicked the link from the menu is shown in parenthesis to help clarify the example; these numbers are not seen in the menu):
>- **Find Users** (20)
>- **Create Class** (19)
>- **Find Classes** (19)
>- **Create Enrollment** (15)
>- **Find Courses** (10)
>- **Create Course Assignment** (8)
>- **Subscription Profiles** (3)
>- **Find Course Assignments** (1)

> You click **Assigned Subscriptions** once from the menu or search results and it doesn’t appear under **History**. However, when you click it again, it now appears and **Find Course Assignments** is no longer listed.

History continues to track your usage each time you open the menu and click a link. When you click **Clear** next to **History**, the counters are reset, and the links are removed. If you prefer to view the menu as a page, you can click **Legacy Admin Page** on the menu. Please be aware that History does not track any links clicked from the **Site Administration** page (Legacy Admin) or any links that are right-clicked and opened in another tab or window regardless of where the link is right-clicked.

## Comparison of Admin menu and Site Administration page
Below is a comparison of the functionality between the Admin menu:

| | **Admin menu** | **Site Administration page** |
|:--------|:--------|:--------|
| **Search** | Use intgrated Search bar in menu. Can click links directly from results or press **Enter** to be taken to first page in results. | Must use browser’s searching capability. |
| **Group Order** | Groups set by default but can view alphabetically (vertical). | Tiles can be rearranged via drag-and-drop. |
| **History** | The 8 most frequently used links display on left side. Dynamically updates as menu used. Can be cleared. Does not record links right-clicked or clicked on Site Administration page. | No history or tracking of usage available for easy access of links. |
