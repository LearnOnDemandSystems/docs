# Can I rearrange items on the Site Administration page?

The Site Administration page can be customized. Related topics are grouped together on tiles to help you navigate quickly. You can rearrange the tiles so the items you work with the most are at the top. To do this:
1. Click and hold on a tile you want to move.
1. Drag it to the spot you want it.

The other tiles will move to make room. Now every time you access the Admin page, you new organization is there until you decide to change it again.
