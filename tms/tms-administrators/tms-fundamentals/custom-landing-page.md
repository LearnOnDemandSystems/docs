# How do I have users land on a custom page when logging in?

If your organization has site in the TMS (a custom URL), you can choose where your students and administrators will land when they sign in. There can be a landing page for your students and a different one for your administrators.

For students, you can choose one of the following for the Default Landing Page:
- **Default** – the default landing page, currently the My Training page
- **My Training** – currently is the same as Default
- **Subscription** – the On-Demand browser
- **Class Browser** – the Class Browser page
- **Custom** – requires the URL of the page you want as the landing page. This can be a page in the TMS or a TMS webpage*.

For users with administrative functions, you can choose the following for the Admin Default Landing Page:
- **Default** – the default landing page set, currently the Site Administration page
- **Site Admin** - currently is the same as Default
- **Custom** – requires the URL of the page you want as the landing page. This can be a page in the TMS or a TMS webpage*.

*Note: If you use a TMS webpage for either landing page, it must be enabled for anonymous access.
