# How do I create completion certificates?

Course completion certificates can be added to the courses of your choice for your staff or your students to print. You can upload one or more certificate templates to associate with courses and these certificates are made available to users to print in the TMS. 

Certificates are available to print by administrators at any time for classes and course assignments. They may edit from a Word file or print using a PDF. Students may print certificates from a PDF if a class enrollment or course assignment shows as Complete on their Transcript.

You may need to contact us for the permissions required to upload or add certificates to courses; or we may need to create the courses for you. Please contact us at **support@learnondemandsystems.com** for assistance or to receive the proper roles in the TMS.

## Steps for adding certificates:

1. Create and upload a certificate template. See [How do I ensure my Course Completion Certificates print correctly?](ensure-completion-certificates-print-correctly.md) for best practices.
