# How do I create a custom event?

> [!Alert] Please be aware that not all functionality covered in this article may be available to you.

Custom events are used to schedule a seminar, a meeting or a class without any of the content available through a course. If you are interested in using this feature, please submit a Support ticket at [**https://lod.one/help**](https://lod.one/help) to be given permissions to create and manage Custom Events.

>[!NOTE] Courses provide content such as labs, video, external sites, assessments and documents. If course content is needed, then a Class should be created instead of a Custom Event.
