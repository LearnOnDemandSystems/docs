# Do I want to use a survey or an assessment?

Surveys and assessments are both means to ask questions of a user.

Surveys are questionnaires to ask for opinions. They allow the user to evaluate an instructor, a class, a building, etc. and there is not an expectation of one correct answer.

Assessments are used to determine the user's comprehension of materials; it is a test or exam with correct and incorrect answers.
