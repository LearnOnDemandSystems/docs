# How can I view lab exam scores?

Administrators, and users given access, can view lab instances to see the length of time the lab was open, if it was completed, is incomplete, or was cancelled, and to see scores on exam labs as well as the answers given by the user. Default settings for viewing lab instances using exams is available from the **Exam Lab Instances** link on classes and the Labs tile in Site Administration.

To view lab instances,
1.	From Site Administration on the Labs tile, select **Exam Lab Instances** or **Find Lab Instances**. 
1.	Add filters as needed, you may wish to add **Instructor name** filters, **Class Name**, **Exam**, **Starts**, **Completion Status**, or others like the student name. 
1.	If viewing exam scores, add output options for **Exam**, **Passed**, **Score**, **Score Percent** or **Passing Score**.
1.	Click **Search** to view the results.
	
> :small_blue_diamond: You can save your search filters and output options to use again or to set as your default view when coming to the page. 

Under the **Completion Status** column, for labs that are **Complete** you may click the **Details** link to view the lab questions, the user’s answers, and the correct answers displayed.
