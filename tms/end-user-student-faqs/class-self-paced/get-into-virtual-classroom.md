# How do I get into my virtual classroom?

What virtual classroom you will access for your class will depend on your organization. 

Please find your section below to see when and how you can access your classroom. 

## Student

You will access your classroom from your Class Enrollment page. 

1. From your **Current Training** page, under **Classes**, click the name of the class to open your **Class Enrollment** page. 

The next steps depend on whether your organization is using an Adobe Connect classroom. If so, please do the following steps through step X. If your organization uses a different classroom program, skip to step X.

1. Prior to class, review the **Get Ready** box.

1. Look at the **Software Check** section and if visible, verify that the **Virtual Classroom Environment** has a green checkmark indicating that your computer has the software needed to launch your virtual classroom. 

    > [!ALERT] If there is an Alert symbol instead, click the **Install** button. This will link you to **https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/** to install the software needed to be able to use the virtual classroom. If you have difficulty downloading this software, please contact either your network administrator or the organization you are taking the class from.

1. Click **Enter Configuration Room** next to **Test Virtual Classroom**. This will allow you to check your audio settings to ensure you are ready for class when it starts. 

1. Click the checkbox to verify you have successfully entered the configuration room.

    > [!KNOWLEDGE] Under the Pre-Class Preparation, you will see a countdown timer 8 hours before the class starts showing how long it will be before the virtual classroom can be launched. The Enter Classroom button will be available thirty minutes before class. 

1. Click **Enter Classroom** to enter your classroom.

Note: You may not see this button prior to class. 


## Instructor

As an instructor you can access the virtual classroom prior to class, but the amount of time before class starts is set by the organization running the class. It may be anywhere from 1 to 60 hours before class. 

When Adobe Connect is being used, a countdown timer will appear 48 hours before you can open the virtual classroom, showing how long it will be before the virtual classroom can be launched.

You will access the classroom from the Class page:

1. Click on **My Calendar** at the top of any window. This will open up your **Instructor Calendar**. 
1. Find your class in the calendar.
1. Click on the class name to open the Class page.
