# How do I print my completion certificate?

If your class or course assignment has completion certificates and you have the required permissions, you can print your completion certificate from the TMS.

Completion certificates can be printed after the class is over and you have been marked complete on the class roster. 

To print the completion certification: 

1. Click **My Transcript** in the navigation bar at the top of the page.  
1. Click the icon for the certificate, to the right of the class or course assignment name.
1. In the **Choose Course Certificate Template** dialog, click the certificate you want to print and click **OK**. 

This will download a pdf of the certificate. Open the file on your local system to print it.

> [!ALERT] If you do not have the permissions required to print your completion certifcate, please reach out to your learning organization for assistance.
