# How do I participate in a discussion?

> :small_blue_diamond: Please note: Please be aware that the functionality covered in this article may not be available to you.

Your class enrollment or course assignment may have a discussion attached to it that allows you and other participants to have an asynchronous conversation. To be able to participate, you must have a role which grants discussion participation AND one of the following based on a course that has a discussion associated with it:

1. A class enrollment in which your status is Enrolled – OR – 
1. An active course assignment,

You will access the discussion through a link on your enrollment or through the Discussion tab of your course. On the main page of the discussion, you may post to the topics listed on the left side. On the right, you have a form to submit a post.

To add a post using the post form on the main page:

1. If available, read the disclaimer at the top of the form.
1. Select the **Post Type: Question** or **Discussion**. Question should be used when you are asking a question with regards to a topic. Discussion should be used when you are sharing your thoughts on a topic.
1. From the **Topic** dropdown select the topic to which you are posting. This dropdown defaults to the first topic.
1. Enter a **Title** for your post. This title is used in the list of posts on the Topic page.
1. Enter your post in the **Your question or idea** field. This is a rich text field.
1. Click **Save**.

To view and participate in the conversation for a **Topic**: 

1. Select the **topic** on the left side. The Topic page opens with the post titles on the left side and a breadcrumb trail above them back to the main discussion page.
1. To add a post, follow the steps above.
1. To read a post, select its **title** from the left side. This opens the post with its responses and comments in the right side of the page. The post, its responses and comments will display in a hierarchical layout with responses indented under the post, and comments indented again under their related responses. The name of the participant and the time will be included.
1. To respond to a post, click **Respond** directly below it, enter your response in the **Add Response** field, and click **Save**.
1. To add a comment to any of the responses, click **Comment** below the appropriate response and follow the same process as for a response. 
1. To like a post, a response, or a comment, simply click the **Like** icon below the element.
1. To see another post’s conversation, click its link on the left side of the page.
1. To see a different topic’s conversation, click the discussion name in the breadcrumb trail.

You may also choose to be notified when there is activity on topic or post. This notification can come through email or as an announcement in the Message Center. Both will provide links back to the Topic and Post.

To follow a **Topic** or **Post**:

1. Click the **star** next to the topic or post you want to follow. This opens a dialog.
1. In the **How would you like to be notified?** dialog, select **E-mail** or **Message Center** and click **OK**.

When a participant, including you, posts on a topic you are following, you will be notified. Same is true when responses are added to a post you are following. You will not be notified when the following occurs:

- Someone comments on a response to a post, whether you are following the post or topic it is under.
- Someone likes a post, response, or comment.
- Someone responds to a post in a topic you are following. Only posts trigger emails or announcements for followed topics.
- A topic or post you are following is deleted by a moderator or administrator.

The announcements and emails include the name of the topic or post which has had activity and a **more** or a **here** link. These open the discussion in a new tab with the item you are following.

Announcement:

> :small_blue_diamond: Please note: When you click **more** in an announcement, the **Message Center** stays open on the original tab and the item is marked as **Read**. You must click **OK** to save the **Read** status of the announcement. If the **Message Center** is opened from another tab before this, the announcement will not show as **Read**.
