Your class enrollment or course assignment may have a discussion attached to it that allows you and other participants to have an asynchronous conversation. To be able to participate, you must have a role which grants discussion participation AND one of the following based on a course that has a discussion associated with it:

1. A class enrollment in which your status is Enrolled – OR – 
1. An active course assignment,

You will access the discussion through a link on your enrollment or through the Discussion tab of your course. On the main page of the discussion, you may post to the topics listed on the left side. On the right, you have a form to submit a post.

To add a post using the post form on the main page:

1. If available, read the disclaimer at the top of the form.
1. Select the **Post Type: Question** or **Discussion**. Question should be used when you are asking a question with regards to a topic. Discussion should be used when you are sharing your thoughts on a topic.
1. From the **Topic** dropdown select the topic to which you are posting. This dropdown defaults to the first topic.
1. Enter a **Title** for your post. This title is used in the list of posts on the Topic page.

The post, its responses and comments will display in a hierarchical layout with responses indented under the post, and comments indented again under their related responses. The name of the participant and the time will be included.
1. To respond to a post, click **Respond** directly below it, enter your response in the **Add Response** field, and click **Save**.

When a participant, including you, posts on a topic you are following, you will be notified. Same is true when responses are added to a post you are following. You will not be notified when the following occurs:

- Someone comments on a response to a post, whether you are following the post or topic it is under.
- Someone likes a post, response, or comment.
- Someone responds to a post in a topic you are following. Only posts trigger emails or announcements for followed topics.
- A topic or post you are following is deleted by a moderator or administrator.

The announcements and emails include the name of the topic or post which has had activity and a **more** or a **here** link. These open the discussion in a new tab with the item you are following.

Announcement:

> [!NOTE] When you click **more** in an announcement, the **Message Center** stays open on the original tab and the item is marked as **Read**. You must click **OK** to save the **Read** status of the announcement. If the **Message Center** is opened from another tab before this, the announcement will not show as **Read**.
