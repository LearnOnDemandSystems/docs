# What is the Upcoming Events link?

Several navigation links can be found at the top of every page in the TMS. One of the links you may see is for **Upcoming Events**; this may also be labeled as **Events** or **Schedule**.

This link opens the **Upcoming Events** page. From it, you can search for any future event held through your organization. It will not show an event or class that has already started or an event that has happened in the past.
