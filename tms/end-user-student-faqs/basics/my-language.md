# How can I see the TMS in my language?

We support your localized language based on your browser’s language setting. Translation is in place for platform-based wording like headings, labels and links. However, any data input into a field (or pulled from a field) displays as it is written. For example, if a course name or class name is input into its name field in English, then it displays everywhere in English.

The only language settings supported outside of English are listed below, using other varieties of the language may not be supported. 
* Chinese (Simplified)
* German - Germany
* Japanese
* Korean
* Portuguese - Portugal
* Spanish - Spain
