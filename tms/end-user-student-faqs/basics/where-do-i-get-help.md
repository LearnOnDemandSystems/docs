## Where do I get Help?

### Do you need to find who to contact for help?

If you are **in the TMS**: 

    At the top of the Site Administration page, **click Contact**. This will open the Contact Information page. This page provides you with email links and phone numbers for who you should contact depending on the type of help you need.

**For assistance with a launched lab**: 

    Contact the help desk for the organization who provided you the lab. In addition, there is a Support tab on the right side of the interface that provides a link to the Help Center as well as Support Information to provide to your helpdesk. Please be aware that this tab may have been disabled by the lab developer.
