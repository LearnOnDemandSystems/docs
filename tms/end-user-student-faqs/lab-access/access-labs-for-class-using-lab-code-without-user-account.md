# How do I access my labs using a lab code without a user account?

Some of our organizations give out lab codes or training keys to unlock access to labs for their users. If this is the case, as a student who has been given a code to access your labs, you should also have received a URL for the site where you will log in or create your user account. The login page for the site you are given will have a place to input a username and password and it will either have a **Create a user account** link  or a **Register with Training Key** field. Directions differ slightly depending on which items you see.  

## Site has a link to **Create a user account**
1. Click **Create a user account**.
1. Fill in all the fields to register and click **Save**. 
1. This will open a Current Training page. Click **Redeem Training Key**. 
1. Input the code you received and click **Redeem Training Key**. 
1. It will return you to the Current Training page with your course added. Click on the course name and your labs will display under the **Activities** section. 
1. Click **Launch** beside the lab you want to start.  

## Site has a field to **Register with Training Key**
1. Input the code you received and click **Register**. 
1. Fill in all the fields to register and click **Save**. 
1. This will open your class Enrollment page, and your labs will display under the Activities section. Click **Launch** beside the lab you want to start.  

Once you have an account and have redeemed your Training Key, you will no longer need the lab code/training key to login. You will simply logon with your username and password at the same URL as before. This will open the Current Training page. You will click on the course name to return to your labs.
