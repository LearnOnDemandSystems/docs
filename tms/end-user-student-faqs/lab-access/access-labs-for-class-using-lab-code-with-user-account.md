# How do I access my labs for a class using a lab code when I have a user account?

Some of our organizations give out lab codes or training keys to unlock access to labs for their users. If you have been given a code to access your labs, you should also have received a URL for the site where you will log in. If you do not have a code or have not been given credentials to log in, please contact your learning organization.

On the URL provided to you:
1. Enter your **username** and **password**, and click **Login**.
1. This opens My Training page. Click **Redeem Training Key**.
1. Enter the training key or code that you received, and click **Redeem Training Key**.

    > You should now be returned to your Current Training page, with your course added. 

1. Click the **course name** and your labs will display under the **Activities** section.
1. Click **Launch** next to the lab you want to start.
