## Courseware Marketplace Customer

If you purchased Learn on Demand Systems labs through the Arvato Courseware Marketplace, read the [Getting Started](./arvato-marketplace/fulfilling-marketplace-order/getting-started.md) article first, then review the following topics/processes to access and manage your orders:

## API Client

If you access the TMS through the API:

> [!ALERT] Our API is written to allow new response fields we add to be ignored by clients. However, to ensure your API calls consistently work, when building your API client, make sure that your implementation is written in such a way as to ignore any fields you are not using in your code. This will help ensure your implementation remains stable while the API can remain dynamic. To assist with this, we have provided our [client library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LearnOnDemandSystems.OneLearnTMS.OneLearnTMSAPIClient/), which adheres to these best practices.
