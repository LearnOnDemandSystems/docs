# How do I assist my students with their labs?

During class you may want to watch your students' progress in their labs. This can be done with the lab monitoring tool.

By using lab monitoring you can see a listing of all students' running labs which includes:

- Name of the lab being worked in.
- Active virtual machine in the lab.
- How long the lab has been running.
- Amount of time since the student's last activity was performed in the lab.

You can also take actions through the lab monitoring tool like:

- View the student's lab as they work in it.
- Take control of the student's lab.
- Share files with students.

> [!NOTE] Monitoring labs is not available when the labs are using ESM in conjunction with Enhanced controller. You may only see the login prompt. One instance is when audio has been enabled on the VMs.

To monitor and assist students:
1. Click **My Calendar** at the top of any window. 
1. This will open up your Instructor Calendar. Find your class in the calendar, and click on the class name to open the **Class** page. You may also access your current class from the My Classes link on the top navigation bar. 
1. Click **Monitor Labs**. 
1. A new browser tab will open up with all your class's active lab instances displayed with pertinent data about their labs. Click the **Monitor Student** to view a student's activity as they work in a lab. 
1. You then have the option to click **Take Control** to work through an exercise with a student.
