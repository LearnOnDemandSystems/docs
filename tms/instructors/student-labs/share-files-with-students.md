# How do I share files with students?

There may be times when you wish to share files with your students. This is simple to do. There are two paths to do this depending on your permissions. You can distribute files from your computer to your students from the **Manage Files** link on the Class Profile or through the **lab monitoring** tool.

## Manage Files

Instructors (and administrators) with the proper permissions can use the Manage Files functionality on a class to share files with students in their class.

To do this:
1. Navigate to the **Class Profile** page for the class you want to share files with.
1. Click **Manage Files** in the quick links bar.
1. On the **Class Files** page, click **Upload File**. ![](/tms/images/class-files.png)


1. Click **Choose File** next to **File** and upload the file you want to share.
1. Change the **Name**, in necessary and add a **Description** that will be visible to the students and other instructors.
1. Ensure the **Visibility** field **Students** checkbox is checked. If it is uncheched, students will not see the files on their class enrollment. ![](/tms/images/class-file-visibility.png)
1. Click **Save**.

Additional files can be uploaded by repeating steps 3 through 7, ensuring proper visibility for each file. Anyone with permission to access the Manage Files link and Class Files page can manage the availability and visibility of all files uploaded regardless of who originally uploaded them.

Files that are set to be visible to students are available to them on their **Class Enrollment** page in the **Class Files** section under **Activities**. They click the name of the file to start the download process to their machine.

## Monitor Labs

There may be times when you want the files to be easily accessed by the students while they are working on a lab without having to leave the lab. For this scenario, you should use the Monitor Labs tool: 
1.  Navigate to the **Class Profile** page for the class.
1. Click **Monitor Labs**. 
1. A new browser tab will open up with all your class's active lab instances displayed. In the **Instructor Files** box, click **Share Files**. 
1. In the **Instructor Files for ...** dialog, click **Upload File**.
1. In the **Upload Instructor File** dialog, enter the **Display Name** for the files and click **Choose files**. 
1. Navigate to the file(s) you want, select it and click **Open**. 
1. Ensure the file(s) you wish to share are listed. Click **OK** through the steps to add the file(s).
1. After replication, ensure the file(s) you wish to share are checked and click **OK**.

A pop-up will appear in each student's launched lab, regardless of what virtual machine they are working on, informing them that a file has been shared by the instructor and how to access that file.
