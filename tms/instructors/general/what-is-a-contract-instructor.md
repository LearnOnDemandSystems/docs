# What does it mean to be a contract instructor?

A contract instructor is an instructor who is available to work for multiple organizations. Any instructor may choose to be a contract instructor. Any organization using the TMS that opts in to use contract instructors can search for qualified instructors based on the competencies they have set up, can view some of the contract instructor's contact information, and schedule instructors for their classes.

Organizations that choose to use contract instructors will see contract instructors when they search for instructors on the Find Instructors search page. They will also be able to view your name, email address, phone numbers, city, state, zip code and country listed within your user profile. The organization cannot view the user profile but can pull this information using output options on the Find Instructors page. They cannot see organizations you have taught for or which organization your user account is under in the TMS.

This allows you, as a contract instructor, to discretely teach for multiple organizations. You can access all of your classes for various organizations using the same login credentials; you do not have to have multiple accounts for each organization you are teaching for. Once you are scheduled in the TMS to teach a class with an organization, you will see the event show up on your instructor calendar. You cannot login using the organization's URL or access a class until you have been added as the instructor of a scheduled class in the TMS. Once you have been added to a class, it is best practice to login for that class using the organization's URL as it will display the logo on the page if you are sharing your screen with students.
