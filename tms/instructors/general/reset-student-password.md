You may, as an instructor, reset a student's password as well as revise their username if they are a student in a class you are teaching.

To change either the password or username:
1. Navigate to the **Class Profile** page and click **Roster**.
1. On the right side of the **Roster** page on the row for the student, click the **Username and Password** icon (looks like a lock). 
1. The Login Credentials: Student dialog opens.
1. Change the **Username** if needed.
1. Check **Change Password** if needed.
    >[!knowledge] Passwords must meet the following complexity requirements: 
    > - 8 characters
    > - 1 number
    > - 1 letter
    > - 1 lower-case letter
    > - 1 special character

    1. Input and confirm the **New Password**.
    1. Click **Save**.

The student will not be notified of the changes. Therefore, please inform them of their new login credentials.

Please Note: You will not be able to reset a password for a user logging in the TMS through an outside authentification sch as Google or Microsoft Live. If you experience any issues resetting a user's password, please submit a Support ticket at [**https://lod.one/help**](https://lod.one/help) and they can assist you.
