# How can I assign access to a class activity to different students?

You can assign specific class activities to each student, enabling them to see and access their assigned activities while other students may see and access different activities. This is helpful for classes where sets of class activities should be completed by different students, like classes using a shared lab environment. 

A course must be set up for Instructor-led training and then any activity in the course can be set to assign manually to students (note: all activity types can be set to manual assignment). When the course is used to create a class, operations managers and instructors can manage the activities to assign or unassign them to one or more students within the class. 

Only students assigned an activity can see or launch it. If an activity is not assigned to any students, then no students will see it. Newly assigned activities display to students within a few seconds, while removed assignments may take up to 25 seconds to be expunged. If the student launched the activity prior to removal, a message displays, stating: Sorry, you don’t currently have access to this activity. Please see instructor.

*Process to manually assign class activities to students.*

Setting manual class activity assignment for students is a different from the [disable class activities feature](/tms/instructors/instructor-prep-and-classes/disable-class-activities.md), which an instructor uses to disable an activity for all students in their class, but the activity is still visible to students. 

A class based on a course with manually assigned activities must assign students to the activities. Any activity with manual assignment enabled has a link to View Activity Access, which can be opened to see the students with access, if no students are assigned then none of them can see the activity. Any activity not requiring manual assignment is seen by all students.

### Class set up

1.	**Create a class** using a course with manual class activity assignment added.
1.	On the class profile, scroll down to the **Activities** section, select the **View Activity Access** link on an assignable activity.
1.	An Activity Access dialog opens, if students have access to the activity they are listed here, if no students are added, a message displays: **There are currently no students assigned to this activity**. To revise student access, click the **Edit Student Access** link.
