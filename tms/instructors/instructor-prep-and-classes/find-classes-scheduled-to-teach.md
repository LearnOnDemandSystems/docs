# How do I find classes I am scheduled to teach?

The easiest way to find classes you are teaching is through the Instructor Calendar. You can see your full schedule in a calendar format.

1. Once you are logged in, click **My Calendar** at the top of any window. 
1. This will open up your Instructor Calendar. Navigate the calendar using the arrow keys.
1. Click **Day**, **Week**, or **Month** to display the calendar in those views. 
1. Next to **Show**, select **individual sessions** to show class sessions you have been assigned as primary instructor or **entire events** to all classes you have assigned to regardless of whether you are primary instructor or not.

[!NOTE] If you are a contract instructor, it is best practice to login for that class using the organization's URL as it will display the logo on the page if you are sharing your screen with students.
