# Why Can't I Find My Completed Labs?

If you can’t find your labs on your **Current Training** page, they will be on your transcript. Once you have taken a class or have completed a course assignment, you can access the labs for a limited time afterwards depending on the type of course.

To access the labs again:
1. Click **My Transcript** at the top of the page. Your completed classed and course assignments will be listed under the appropriate (Classes or Course Assignments) section.
1. Click the name of the class or course assignment whose labs you want to access. 
1. Under **Activities**, click **Launch** next to the lab you want to use.

 If there is no Launch button, the labs have expired. You will need to contact your training center for an extension if you still want access to the labs.
